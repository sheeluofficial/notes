## 1.2 Properties of Numbers

### 1. Commutative Property

The **commutative property** states that the order in which two numbers are added or multiplied does not affect the result.

- **Addition**: a + b = b + a
  - **Example**: 5 + 3 = 3 + 5 = 8

- **Multiplication**: a √ó b = b √ó a
  - **Example**: 4 √ó 6 = 6 √ó 4 = 24

**Real-Life Application**: 
- **Addition**: When calculating total distance covered, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you add morning and evening travel distances in any order.
- **Multiplication**: If you need to find the area of a rectangle, you can multiply length by width or width by length; the order doesn‚Äôt matter.

### 2. Associative Property

The **associative property** states that the way numbers are grouped in addition or multiplication does not affect the result.

- **Addition**: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
  - **Example**: (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9

- **Multiplication**: (a √ó b) √ó c = a √ó (b √ó c)
  - **Example**: (5 √ó 2) √ó 3 = 5 √ó (2 √ó 3) = 30

**Real-Life Application**:
- **Addition**: Calculating total weight of packages by grouping them in different ways doesn‚Äôt change the total weight.
- **Multiplication**: Grouping ingredients in a recipe for a larger batch doesn‚Äôt affect the end product.

### 3. Distributive Property

The **distributive property** relates addition and multiplication and states that multiplying a sum by a number is the same as multiplying each addend individually by the number and then adding the results.

- **Formula**: a √ó (b + c) = (a √ó b) + (a √ó c)
  - **Example**: 3 √ó (4 + 5) = (3 √ó 4) + (3 √ó 5) = 12 + 15 = 27

**Real-Life Application**: 
- **Budgeting**: If you buy multiple items with different prices, you can calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them up to get the total.

### 4. Identity Elements

An **identity element** in an operation is a number that, when combined with any number using that operation, leaves the original number unchanged.

- **Additive Identity**: The number 0. Adding 0 to any number does not change its value.
  - **Formula**: a + 0 = a
  - **Example**: 9 + 0 = 9
  
- **Multiplicative Identity**: The number 1. Multiplying any number by 1 does not change its value.
  - **Formula**: a √ó 1 = a
  - **Example**: 7 √ó 1 = 7

**Real-Life Application**: 
- **Additive Identity**: Zero is commonly used as a starting or reference point, such as in temperature (0¬∞C as freezing).
- **Multiplicative Identity**: Any scaling factor of 1 keeps the original size, as in ‚Äú1x‚Äù settings for volume or playback speed.

### 5. Inverse Elements

An **inverse element** in an operation is a number that, when combined with another number, produces the identity element.

- **Additive Inverse**: The additive inverse of a is -a, because a + (-a) = 0.
  - **Example**: The additive inverse of 5 is -5 because 5 + (-5) = 0.

- **Multiplicative Inverse** (Reciprocal): The multiplicative inverse of a (where a ‚â† 0) is 1/a, because a √ó (1/a) = 1.
  - **Example**: The multiplicative inverse of 4 is 1/4 because 4 √ó (1/4) = 1.

**Real-Life Application**:
- **Additive Inverse**: In finance, earning back an expense (like a refund) cancels the debt created by the initial expense.
- **Multiplicative Inverse**: Scaling down measurements by half in a recipe involves using the reciprocal of the scaling factor.

### 6. Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)

The **order of operations** determines the sequence in which different operations should be performed in a mathematical expression to get the correct result. The order is as follows:

- **PEMDAS/BODMAS**:
  - **P/B**: Parentheses/Brackets
  - **E/O**: Exponents/Orders (powers and roots)
  - **MD**: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
  - **AS**: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

- **Example**: Solve 3 + 6 √ó (5 + 4) √∑ 3^2:
  - Step 1: Solve inside the parentheses (5 + 4 = 9).
  - Step 2: Calculate the exponent 3^2 = 9.
  - Step 3: Multiply and divide from left to right: 6 √ó 9 = 54 and then 54 √∑ 9 = 6.
  - Step 4: Add: 3 + 6 = 9.

### 7. Types of Numbers

## 1.3 Divisibility Rules

Divisibility rules help us quickly determine if one number can be evenly divided by another without performing actual division. Here are the rules for divisibility by common divisors:

### Divisibility by 2
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).
- **Example**: 128 is divisible by 2 because the last digit is 8.
- **Real-Life Application**: Checking divisibility by 2 can help when splitting items equally between two groups.

### Divisibility by 3
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
- **Example**: For 153, the sum of digits is 1 + 5 + 3 = 9, and 9 is divisible by 3, so 153 is divisible by 3.
- **Real-Life Application**: This rule is useful in financial contexts where a bill or an amount needs to be split among three people or categories.

### Divisibility by 4
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4.
- **Example**: For 312, the last two digits are 12, which is divisible by 4, so 312 is divisible by 4.
- **Real-Life Application**: Divisibility by 4 is helpful in situations where items need to be divided evenly into four groups, such as seating arrangements.

### Divisibility by 5
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
- **Example**: 245 is divisible by 5 because the last digit is 5.
- **Real-Life Application**: This rule is commonly used in accounting for cash handling, as bills and coins are often in multiples of 5.

### Divisibility by 6
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
- **Example**: 114 is divisible by 6 because it‚Äôs divisible by 2 (last digit is 4, an even number) and by 3 (sum of digits 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which is divisible by 3).
- **Real-Life Application**: Divisibility by 6 is useful in tasks involving splitting items into 6 groups, like evenly distributing materials.

### Divisibility by 8
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number divisible by 8.
- **Example**: For 4,096, the last three digits are 096, and 96 is divisible by 8, so 4,096 is divisible by 8.
- **Real-Life Application**: Dividing items like blocks or tiles for construction into groups of 8 uses this rule.

### Divisibility by 9
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
- **Example**: For 729, the sum of digits is 7 + 2 + 9 = 18, and 18 is divisible by 9, so 729 is divisible by 9.
- **Real-Life Application**: Useful in checking divisibility for quantities grouped in nines, like certain packaging setups or shipments.

### Divisibility by 10
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.
- **Example**: 540 is divisible by 10 because the last digit is 0.
- **Real-Life Application**: Used in metric conversions or rounding numbers to the nearest ten.

### Divisibility by 11
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including 0).
- **Example**: For 1,210, the alternating sums are 1 + 1 = 2 (odd positions) and 2 + 0 = 2 (even positions). 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11, so 1,210 is divisible by 11.
- **Real-Life Application**: This rule can be helpful in certain coding or encryption contexts where alternating sums are analyzed.

### Summary Table of Divisibility Rules

| Divisor | Rule Example | Rule Description |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 2       | Last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) | For even numbers |
| 3       | Sum of digits is divisible by 3 | Used in splitting sums |
| 4       | Last two digits form a number divisible by 4 | Useful for groups of 4 |
| 5       | Last digit is 0 or 5 | Cash and currency handling |
| 6       | Divisible by both 2 and 3 | Common for 6-part groups |
| 8       | Last three digits form a number divisible by 8 | Construction and tiling |
| 9       | Sum of digits is divisible by 9 | Packaging in 9s |
| 10      | Last digit is 0 | Rounding and metric conversions |
| 11      | Alternating sum of digits difference divisible by 11 | Coding/encryption |

### Testing Divisibility with Examples

1. **Is 376 divisible by 4?**
   - **Solution**: Check the last two digits (76). Since 76 is divisible by 4, 376 is divisible by 4.

2. **Is 245 divisible by 9?**
   - **Solution**: Sum of the digits is 2 + 4 + 5 = 11, which is not divisible by 9. So, 245 is not divisible by 9.

3. **Is 3,564 divisible by 11?**
   - **Solution**: Alternating sums: 3 + 6 = 9 (odd positions) and 5 + 4 = 9 (even positions). 9 - 9 = 0, which is divisible by 11, so 3,564 is divisible by 11.

## 1.4 Prime Numbers and Factors

### Prime Numbers

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means it can only be divided evenly by 1 and the number itself.

- **Examples of Prime Numbers**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
- **Note**: The number 2 is the only even prime number because any other even number can be divided by 2.

### Properties of Prime Numbers

1. **Uniqueness**: Prime numbers have only two divisors.
2. **Infinite Set**: There is an infinite number of prime numbers.
3. **Building Blocks of Numbers**: Prime numbers are the "building blocks" of the natural numbers, as any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (called prime factorization).

**Real-Life Application**:
Prime numbers play a key role in cryptography and security. Many encryption systems, such as RSA, use large prime numbers to secure digital communication.

### Composite Numbers

A **composite number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. This means it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.

- **Examples of Composite Numbers**: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, etc.
- **Note**: Every composite number can be factored into a product of prime numbers.

### Methods to Identify Prime Numbers

1. **Trial Division**: To determine if a number n is prime, test if n is divisible by any prime number up to ‚àön.
   - **Example**: To check if 29 is prime, check divisibility by prime numbers up to ‚àö29 ‚âà 5.4. Since 29 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, it is prime.

2. **Prime Factorization**: Breaking down a number into a product of prime factors can help determine if a number is prime.
   - **Example**: For 20, we get 20 = 2 √ó 2 √ó 5, which shows it‚Äôs a composite number.

3. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: An ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a certain limit. It systematically marks the multiples of each prime, starting with 2, then moving to the next unmarked number.

   **Steps for the Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - Write down numbers from 2 up to the desired limit.
   - Start with the first prime, 2, and mark all multiples of 2.
   - Move to the next unmarked number, 3, and mark all multiples of 3.
   - Repeat this process until all multiples of each prime are marked.
   - The unmarked numbers are primes.

### Prime Factorization

**Prime factorization** is the process of expressing a composite number as the product of its prime factors. It‚Äôs unique for each number, known as the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**.

- **Example**: The prime factorization of 60 is 60 = 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 5 or 60 = 2¬≤ √ó 3 √ó 5.

**Real-Life Application**:
Prime factorization is useful in finding the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) of numbers, essential for tasks like scheduling and dividing assets.

### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) or Highest Common Factor (HCF)

The **GCD** (or HCF) of two or more numbers is the largest number that divides each of them without leaving a remainder.

#### 1. Prime Factorization Method

In this method, we factorize each number into its prime factors and find the common factors.

- **Steps**:
  1. Find the prime factors of each number.
  2. Identify all common prime factors.
  3. Multiply the lowest power of each common prime factor to get the HCF.

- **Example**: HCF of 36 and 48
  - Prime factors of 36: 2¬≤ √ó 3¬≤
  - Prime factors of 48: 2‚Å¥ √ó 3
  - Common prime factors: 2¬≤ and 3
  - HCF: 2¬≤ √ó 3 = 4 √ó 3 = 12

#### 2. Euclidean Algorithm (Efficient for Large Numbers)

The Euclidean Algorithm is a highly efficient way to find the HCF, especially for large numbers. It uses division to repeatedly reduce the size of the numbers.

- **Steps**:
  1. For two numbers a and b (where a > b), divide a by b and note the remainder r.
  2. Replace a with b and b with r.
  3. Repeat until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the HCF.

- **Example**: HCF of 56 and 98
  - 98 √∑ 56 = 1 remainder 42
  - 56 √∑ 42 = 1 remainder 14
  - 42 √∑ 14 = 3 remainder 0
  - HCF is 14.

#### 3. Division Method (Long Division for Finding HCF)

The Division Method is a variation of the Euclidean algorithm, where we repeatedly divide until the remainder is zero, similar to how we perform long division.

- **Steps**:
  1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.
  2. Use the remainder as the new divisor and the previous divisor as the new dividend.
  3. Repeat until the remainder is zero. The last divisor is the HCF.

- **Example**: HCF of 150 and 275
  - Divide 275 by 150 to get a remainder of 125.
  - Divide 150 by 125 to get a remainder of 25.
  - Divide 125 by 25 to get a remainder of 0.
  - HCF is 25.

#### 4. Consecutive Integer Checking Method (Useful for Small Numbers)

This method involves checking numbers starting from the smaller of the given numbers and working downwards until a common factor is found.

- **Steps**:
  1. List all factors of the smaller number.
  2. Check each factor in descending order to see if it divides the larger number.
  3. The first common factor found is the HCF.

- **Example**: HCF of 30 and 42
  - Factors of 30: 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1
  - Testing these against 42, we find that 6 is the highest factor of both.

#### 5. Binary GCD Algorithm (Optimized for Computers)

This algorithm, also called the Stein‚Äôs Algorithm, finds the HCF using bitwise operations. It is efficient for binary systems (used in computing).

- **Steps**:
  1. If both numbers are even, divide both by 2 and double the result at the end.
  2. If one number is even and the other is odd, divide the even number by 2.
  3. If both are odd, replace the larger number with the difference and repeat.
  4. Stop when the numbers become equal, which is the HCF.

- **Example**: Find the HCF of 48 and 18 using the Binary GCD Algorithm.
  - Step 1: Both numbers are even, so divide both by 2 ‚Üí 24 and 9.
  - Step 2: 24 is even, 9 is odd, so divide 24 by 2 ‚Üí 12 and 9.
  - Step 3: 12 is even, so divide by 2 ‚Üí 6 and 9.
  - Step 4: Subtract the smaller from the larger ‚Üí 3 and 6.
  - Repeat until both numbers equal 3.
  - HCF is 3.
**Real-Life Application**:
GCD is useful for simplifying fractions, arranging items into groups, and optimizing resource use.

## 1.5 Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

### Definition of LCM

The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two or more numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of these numbers. In other words, it is the smallest multiple that the numbers share.

- **Example**: The LCM of 4 and 5 is 20 because 20 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 4 and 5.

### Relationship Between LCM and Prime Factors

The LCM of two numbers can be found by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in their factorizations.

- **Example**: LCM of 12 and 15
  - Prime factors of 12: 2¬≤ √ó 3
  - Prime factors of 15: 3 √ó 5
  - LCM: 2¬≤ √ó 3 √ó 5 = 60

### Methods to Find LCM

There are several methods to calculate the LCM of two or more numbers. Here are three commonly used methods:

#### 1. Listing Multiples Method

This is a straightforward method, where we list the multiples of each number until we find the smallest common multiple.

- **Steps**:
  1. List the first few multiples of each number.
  2. Identify the smallest common multiple in these lists.

- **Example**: LCM of 6 and 8
  - Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...
  - Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, ...
  - The smallest common multiple is 24, so LCM(6, 8) = 24.

#### 2. Prime Factorization Method

This method involves breaking down each number into its prime factors, then taking the highest power of each prime factor present in any of the numbers.

- **Steps**:
  1. Find the prime factors of each number.
  2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor that appears.
  3. Multiply these highest powers to get the LCM.

- **Example**: LCM of 20 and 30
  - Prime factors of 20: 2¬≤ √ó 5
  - Prime factors of 30: 2 √ó 3 √ó 5
  - LCM: 2¬≤ √ó 3 √ó 5 = 60

#### 3. Using the Relationship Between LCM and GCD

The relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers `a` and `b` is given by:

LCM(a, b) = |a √ó b| / GCD(a, b)


This method is especially useful when the GCD is known, as it simplifies the LCM calculation.

- **Steps**:
  1. Calculate the GCD of the two numbers (using any preferred method).
  2. Divide the product of the numbers by their GCD to get the LCM.

- **Example**: LCM of 18 and 24
  - 18 √ó 24 = 432
  - GCD of 18 and 24 is 6.
  - LCM(18, 24) = 432 / 6 = 72

#### 4. Division Method for Multiple Numbers

This method is effective for finding the LCM of more than two numbers. The process involves dividing the numbers by their common prime factors step-by-step.

- **Steps**:
  1. Write down all the numbers in a row.
  2. Divide by the smallest prime number that can divide at least one of the numbers.
  3. For each division, write down the result below the original numbers.
  4. Continue dividing the results by the next smallest prime factor until all entries are reduced to 1.
  5. Multiply all the divisors to get the LCM.

**Example**: LCM of 8, 12, and 15

- **Step 1**: Write 8, 12, and 15.
- **Step 2**: Divide by 2 (the smallest prime factor).
  - Results: 8 √∑ 2 = 4, 12 √∑ 2 = 6, 15 (unchanged as it's not divisible by 2).
- **Step 3**: Divide by 2 again for numbers still divisible by 2.
  - Results: 4 √∑ 2 = 2, 6 √∑ 2 = 3, 15.
- **Step 4**: Divide by 2 one last time.
  - Results: 2 √∑ 2 = 1, 3, 15.
- **Step 5**: Divide by 3.
  - Results: 1, 3 √∑ 3 = 1, 15 √∑ 3 = 5.
- **Step 6**: Finally, divide by 5.
  - Results: 1, 1, 5 √∑ 5 = 1.
- Multiply all divisors: 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 5 = 120.

**LCM(8, 12, 15) = 120**.

### Real-Life Applications of LCM

1. **Scheduling Events**: LCM helps in finding common cycles. For example, if two tasks repeat every 4 and 6 days, respectively, the LCM can be used to determine when they will occur on the same day (e.g., every 12 days).
  
2. **Solving Problems Involving Rotations**: LCM is used in problems where events or signals with different periods synchronize. For instance, if traffic lights at two intersections change every 30 and 45 seconds, respectively, they will align every 90 seconds (the LCM of 30 and 45).

3. **Packaging and Grouping**: LCM helps in situations where items need to be grouped or packed evenly across multiple groups without leftovers.

### Definition of GCD

The **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two or more numbers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers without a remainder. It‚Äôs sometimes referred to as the **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)** or **Highest Common Factor (HCF)**. The GCD is especially useful in simplifying fractions, dividing quantities evenly, and solving problems related to ratios.

- **Example**: The GCD of 18 and 24 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides both 18 and 24 without leaving a remainder.

### Key Properties of GCD

1. **Divisibility**: The GCD of two numbers divides each number exactly.
2. **Associative Property**: The GCD of more than two numbers is associative, meaning `GCD(a, b, c) = GCD(GCD(a, b), c)`.
3. **Relatively Prime Numbers**: If the GCD of two numbers is 1, they are called **relatively prime** or **coprime**. This means the two numbers have no common factors other than 1.

### Real-Life Applications of GCD

1. **Reducing Fractions**: The GCD helps simplify fractions by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.
   - **Example**: To reduce 18/24, we find the GCD of 18 and 24 (which is 6) and divide both by 6, resulting in 3/4.

2. **Grouping and Packaging**: GCD is useful in situations where items need to be grouped evenly. For instance, if you have 18 red balls and 24 blue balls and want to group them with an equal number of each color in each group, the GCD tells you the maximum number of groups you can make (in this case, 6).

3. **Tiling Problems**: GCD is used to determine the largest size of a square tile that can be used to tile a rectangular area without cutting any tiles. 

4. **Synchronization of Events**: When two events happen periodically, GCD can help find the interval at which both events will occur simultaneously. For instance, if two lights flash every 18 seconds and 24 seconds, respectively, they will flash together every 6 seconds (the GCD of 18 and 24).

### Methods to Find GCD

#### 1. Listing Factors Method

This basic method involves listing all the factors of each number and identifying the largest common factor.

- **Steps**:
  1. List all factors of each number.
  2. Identify the largest factor that appears in both lists.

- **Example**: GCD of 12 and 16
  - Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
  - Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
  - The largest common factor is 4, so GCD(12, 16) = 4.

#### 2. Prime Factorization Method

In this method, we break down each number into its prime factors, then take the lowest power of each common prime factor to determine the GCD.

- **Steps**:
  1. Find the prime factors of each number.
  2. Identify the common prime factors and take the lowest power of each.
  3. Multiply these values to get the GCD.

- **Example**: GCD of 18 and 24
  - Prime factors of 18: 2 √ó 3¬≤
  - Prime factors of 24: 2¬≥ √ó 3
  - Common prime factors: 2 and 3
  - GCD: 2 √ó 3 = 6

#### 3. Euclidean Algorithm

The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient and widely used method for finding the GCD of two numbers. It uses the property that `GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b)`, which means the GCD of two numbers is the same as the GCD of the smaller number and the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number.

- **Steps**:
  1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number and take the remainder.
  2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder.
  3. Repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

- **Example**: GCD of 48 and 18
  - 48 mod 18 = 12
  - 18 mod 12 = 6
  - 12 mod 6 = 0
  - **Result**: GCD(48, 18) = 6

#### 4. Binary GCD Method (Stein's Algorithm)

The Binary GCD method is a highly efficient algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers using bitwise operations. It‚Äôs useful for very large numbers and operates on the principles of factoring out powers of 2 and using subtraction.

- **Steps**:
  1. If both numbers are even, factor out a power of 2 from both and keep track of it.
  2. If one number is even and the other is odd, remove the factor of 2 from the even number.
  3. If both numbers are odd, subtract the smaller from the larger.
  4. Repeat until the numbers are equal. The result, multiplied by the factors of 2 removed, gives the GCD.

### Relationship Between LCM and GCD

The GCD and LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` have a special relationship:

LCM(a, b) √ó GCD(a, b) = |a √ó b|


This equation allows us to find one if the other and the product of the two numbers are known. This relationship is particularly useful in number theory and helps simplify calculations in problems involving multiple values.

## 1.6 Fractions and Decimals

### Understanding Fractions

A **fraction** is a mathematical representation of a part of a whole. In a fraction, the number above the line is called the **numerator**, which represents how many parts are taken, and the number below the line is the **denominator**, representing the total number of equal parts that make up the whole. Fractions are fundamental in mathematics because they allow us to represent parts of numbers, enabling calculations with partial quantities.

- **Example**: The fraction 3/4 indicates 3 parts out of a total of 4 parts.

### Types of Fractions

1. **Proper Fractions**: These are fractions where the numerator is smaller than the denominator. Since these fractions represent quantities smaller than a whole, they always lie between 0 and 1.
   - **Example**: 3/5, meaning 3 out of 5 parts.
   
2. **Improper Fractions**: Here, the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator, meaning the fraction represents a value greater than or equal to one whole.
   - **Example**: 7/4, which is more than 1 whole (or 1 3/4 when converted to a mixed fraction).
   
3. **Mixed Fractions**: These are a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction. Mixed fractions are another way to represent improper fractions in a more understandable form.
   - **Example**: 1 3/4, which means one whole and an additional 3/4.

### Converting Between Improper and Mixed Fractions

Understanding how to convert between improper and mixed fractions is essential, especially when dealing with real-life problems where mixed fractions are often more intuitive.

- **Improper to Mixed**:
  1. Divide the numerator by the denominator.
  2. The quotient (whole number part) becomes the whole number in the mixed fraction.
  3. The remainder becomes the new numerator, and the denominator remains the same.

   - **Example**: 11/4 = 2 3/4, since 11 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 3.

- **Mixed to Improper**:
  1. Multiply the whole number by the denominator.
  2. Add this result to the numerator.
  3. Write the result over the original denominator.

   - **Example**: 2 3/4 can be converted to an improper fraction as (2 * 4 + 3) / 4 = 11/4.

### Operations with Fractions

#### 1. Addition and Subtraction

To add or subtract fractions, it's essential that the fractions have the same denominator, known as a **common denominator**. This is because fractions with different denominators represent parts of different-sized wholes, which can‚Äôt be directly added or subtracted.

1. **Find the Least Common Denominator (LCD)**: This is the smallest multiple common to both denominators.
2. **Adjust the fractions** so that they share the LCD.
3. **Add or subtract the numerators** while keeping the common denominator.

- **Example**: To add 1/3 and 1/4:
  - Find the LCD of 3 and 4, which is 12.
  - Convert each fraction: 1/3 = 4/12 and 1/4 = 3/12.
  - Now, 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.

#### 2. Multiplication

Multiplying fractions is straightforward: multiply the numerators to get the new numerator, and multiply the denominators to get the new denominator. The product represents the part of the whole remaining after multiplication.

- **Formula**: (a/b) √ó (c/d) = (a * c) / (b * d)

- **Example**: 2/3 √ó 3/4 = (2 * 3) / (3 * 4) = 6/12 = 1/2.

#### 3. Division

Dividing fractions involves multiplying the first fraction by the **reciprocal** of the second fraction. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator.

- **Formula**: (a/b) √∑ (c/d) = (a/b) √ó (d/c) = (a * d) / (b * c)

- **Example**: 3/5 √∑ 2/7 = 3/5 √ó 7/2 = 21/10 = 2 1/10.

#### Fraction Simplification

Simplifying a fraction means reducing it to its lowest terms by dividing the numerator and denominator by their **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**. This step is crucial for clearer, easier-to-manage results.

- **Example**: Simplify 12/16.
  - GCD of 12 and 16 is 4.
  - Divide both the numerator and denominator by 4: 12/16 = 3/4.

### Decimals

A **decimal** is a way of expressing a fraction, particularly one with a denominator that is a power of 10 (such as 10, 100, 1000). Decimals are written with a point (called the decimal point) to separate the whole number part from the fractional part. Decimals are widely used in financial and scientific contexts for greater precision and simplicity.

- **Example**: 0.75 represents the fraction 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4.

### Types of Decimals

1. **Terminating Decimals**: These are decimals that end after a certain number of digits. They can always be expressed as fractions with denominators that are powers of 10.
   - **Example**: 0.5, which represents 5/10 or 1/2.
   
2. **Recurring Decimals**: These decimals have one or more repeating digits or sequences of digits that continue indefinitely. They are often written with a bar above the repeating section.
   - **Example**: 0.333... can be written as 0.\overline{3}, which is equivalent to 1/3.

### Converting Between Fractions and Decimals

#### Fraction to Decimal

To convert a fraction to a decimal:
1. **Divide the numerator by the denominator** to get a decimal form. 
2. Identify if the decimal terminates or repeats. If the division does not end, you can either stop after a certain number of decimal places or denote it as a recurring decimal.

   - **Example**: 3/4 = 0.75 (terminating), 1/3 = 0.333... (recurring).

#### Decimal to Fraction

1. **For Terminating Decimals**:
   - Count the decimal places.
   - Use this count to create the denominator (1 followed by as many zeros as there are decimal places).
   - Simplify the fraction if possible.

   - **Example**: 0.75 has two decimal places, so it‚Äôs 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4.

2. **For Recurring Decimals**:
   - Set up an equation to represent the decimal as a variable (e.g., x = 0.666...).
   - Multiply both sides to shift the decimal point to the start of the repeating sequence (e.g., 10x = 6.666...).
   - Subtract to remove the repeating part and solve for the fraction.

   - **Example**: 0.666... = x. Then 10x = 6.666..., so 10x - x = 6, resulting in x = 6/9 = 2/3.

### Summary

Fractions and decimals are crucial for representing and working with parts of a whole. They are two ways of expressing non-integer quantities, and converting between them is an important skill. Mastering operations with fractions and decimals is foundational for more complex math, including algebra, probability, and statistics.

### Rounding Decimals

1. Identify the rounding position (e.g., nearest tenth).
2. Look at the digit to the right of this position:
   - If it‚Äôs 5 or greater, round up.
   - If it‚Äôs less than 5, keep the rounding position unchanged.

   - **Example**: Round 3.456 to the nearest tenth.
     - The answer is 3.5.

### Real-Life Applications of Fractions and Decimals

1. **Financial Transactions**: Fractions and decimals are essential in currency calculations, tax, discounts, and interest rates.
2. **Cooking and Measurements**: Recipes often require fractional quantities (e.g., \( \frac{1}{4}\) cup) and measurements may use decimals for precision.
3. **Time and Distance Calculations**: Time often requires conversions between fractional hours and decimals (e.g., 1.5 hours as 1 hour and 30 minutes).
4. **Engineering and Construction**: Dimensions are often represented as decimals for precise measurements, and fractions are used for sizing materials (e.g., lumber size).

## 1.7 Percentages

### Definition of Percentage

A **percentage** is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100, denoted by the symbol "%." Percentages are widely used in mathematics and daily life to express proportions, compare quantities, and calculate ratios. This concept allows for easy comparisons and measurements in terms of parts per hundred, making it an essential tool for understanding financial transactions, statistics, and probability.

- **Example**: 50% means 50 out of 100, which can be expressed as 50/100 or simplified as 0.5.

### Converting Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages

Understanding how to convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages is important as it helps in various calculations and makes it easier to interpret data across different formats.

#### 1. Converting a Fraction to a Percentage

To convert a fraction to a percentage:
1. Divide the numerator by the denominator to get a decimal.
2. Multiply the result by 100 and add the "%" symbol.

- **Example**: For 3/4:
  - 3 divided by 4 is 0.75.
  - 0.75 multiplied by 100 equals 75%, so 3/4 = 75%.

#### 2. Converting a Decimal to a Percentage

To convert a decimal to a percentage:
1. Multiply the decimal by 100.
2. Add the "%" symbol.

- **Example**: 0.35 multiplied by 100 equals 35%, so 0.35 = 35%.

#### 3. Converting a Percentage to a Fraction

To convert a percentage to a fraction:
1. Write the percentage as a fraction with 100 as the denominator.
2. Simplify the fraction if possible.

- **Example**: 40% becomes 40/100, which simplifies to 2/5.

#### 4. Converting a Percentage to a Decimal

To convert a percentage to a decimal:
1. Divide the percentage by 100.

- **Example**: 25% divided by 100 is 0.25, so 25% = 0.25.

### Finding Percentages of Numbers

To find a percentage of a number:
1. Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.
2. Multiply this decimal by the number to get the desired percentage.

- **Example**: To find 30% of 200:
  - Convert 30% to a decimal: 30% = 0.3.
  - Multiply: 0.3 * 200 = 60.
  - So, 30% of 200 is 60.

### Percentage Increase and Decrease

**1. Percentage Increase**: This represents the percentage by which an initial amount grows. It is used in scenarios like price hikes, population growth, and profit calculations.

- **Formula**:  
  Percentage Increase = ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100

- **Example**: Original price = $50, New price = $65.
  - Increase = 65 - 50 = 15.
  - Percentage Increase = (15 / 50) * 100 = 30%.

**2. Percentage Decrease**: This is the percentage by which an initial amount reduces. It is commonly used for discounts, price drops, and depreciation.

- **Formula**:  
  Percentage Decrease = ((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) * 100

- **Example**: Original price = $80, New price = $60.
  - Decrease = 80 - 60 = 20.
  - Percentage Decrease = (20 / 80) * 100 = 25%.

### Real-Life Applications of Percentages

1. **Discounts in Shopping**: Retailers frequently offer percentage discounts. A discount of 20% off the price means the customer pays 80% of the original price.

   - **Example**: For an item priced at $100 with a 20% discount:
     - Amount to pay = 100 - (100 * 0.2) = 80.

2. **Interest Rates**: Banks use percentages to calculate interest. For instance, a 5% interest rate on a principal amount shows how much will be earned or owed after a certain period.

3. **Tax Calculations**: Taxes, such as sales tax, are computed as a percentage of the sale price. If an item is $50 with an 8% sales tax, the tax adds $4, making the total $54.

4. **Population Growth**: Population growth or decline is often expressed in percentages, which helps to measure demographic changes over time.

   - **Example**: If a town‚Äôs population of 10,000 grows by 5%, the new population is calculated as:
     - 10,000 + (10,000 * 0.05) = 10,500.

### Key Formulas

## 1.8 Ratios and Proportions

### Ratios

A **ratio** is a comparison between two or more quantities, showing how many times one value contains or is contained within the other. Ratios are typically written in the form "a : b" (read as "a to b") or as a fraction, "a/b." Ratios are essential in mathematics for understanding relationships between quantities, allowing us to express and analyze these relationships.

- **Example**: If there are 2 apples and 3 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 2 : 3, meaning that for every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges.

### Understanding Ratios

1. **Simplifying Ratios**: Just like fractions, ratios can be simplified by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor (GCD). This makes ratios easier to work with and compare.

   - **Example**: The ratio 10 : 15 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their GCD, which is 5, resulting in the simplified ratio 2 : 3.

2. **Equivalent Ratios**: Ratios that express the same relationship are known as equivalent ratios. To find an equivalent ratio, multiply or divide both terms of the ratio by the same non-zero number.

   - **Example**: The ratio 4 : 6 is equivalent to 2 : 3 (dividing both terms by 2), as both ratios represent the same relationship.

### Types of Ratios

1. **Part-to-Part Ratio**: This type of ratio compares one part of a group to another part within the same group.

   - **Example**: In a classroom with 10 boys and 15 girls, the ratio of boys to girls is 10 : 15, which simplifies to 2 : 3.

2. **Part-to-Whole Ratio**: This ratio compares one part of a group to the entire group, showing the relationship between a part and the total.

   - **Example**: In the same classroom of 25 students (10 boys and 15 girls), the ratio of boys to total students is 10 : 25, which simplifies to 2 : 5.

### Real-Life Applications of Ratios

1. **Recipes**: Ratios are commonly used in cooking to maintain the correct proportion of ingredients. For example, a pasta sauce might require a 1 : 3 ratio of tomato paste to water, which can be scaled up or down depending on the number of servings.

2. **Map Scales**: Maps often use ratios to represent scale, such as 1 cm : 100 km, meaning 1 cm on the map represents 100 km in real life.

3. **Financial Ratios**: Ratios are used in finance to assess a company's health, such as the debt-to-income ratio or profit margin ratio, offering insights into financial stability.

### Proportions

A **proportion** is an equation that states that two ratios are equal, showing that two fractions or ratios represent the same relationship. Proportions are used to solve problems involving equivalent ratios.

- **Example**: The ratios 2 : 3 and 4 : 6 form a proportion because they express the same relationship. This can be written as 2/3 = 4/6.

### Solving Proportions

To determine if two ratios form a proportion or to solve for a missing term in a proportion, use **cross-multiplication**. This technique involves multiplying the terms of each ratio diagonally and checking for equality.

1. **Cross-Multiplication**:
   - If two ratios are in proportion, say a/b = c/d, then cross-multiplying gives a * d = b * c.
   - **Example**: For the proportion 2/3 = 4/6, cross-multiplying gives 2 * 6 = 3 * 4, which is 12 = 12, confirming that the ratios are proportional.

2. **Solving for an Unknown**:
   - To find a missing term in a proportion, set up an equation using cross-multiplication and then solve for the unknown term.

   - **Example**: Given 3/4 = x/8, we can cross-multiply to solve for x:
     - Multiply 3 * 8 = 4 * x, which simplifies to 24 = 4x, so x = 6.

### Direct and Inverse Proportion

1. **Direct Proportion**: Two quantities are directly proportional if one quantity increases or decreases in direct relation to the other. This relationship can be represented as y = k * x, where k is the constant of proportionality.

   - **Example**: If 1 book costs $5, then the cost y of x books is given by y = 5 * x. For 3 books, the cost is 3 * 5 = 15.

2. **Inverse Proportion**: Two quantities are inversely proportional if one increases when the other decreases, meaning their product remains constant. This relationship can be represented as y = k/x, where k is a constant.

   - **Example**: If 4 workers can complete a job in 8 hours, then reducing the number of workers to 2 would increase the time needed to 16 hours, as the number of workers and time are inversely proportional.

### Solving Direct and Inverse Proportion Problems

#### Direct Proportion

1. Identify if the relationship is direct by determining whether an increase in one quantity leads to an increase in the other.
2. Use the formula y = k * x, and solve for k if necessary.
3. Substitute values to find unknown quantities.

   - **Example**: If a car travels 60 km in 2 hours, we can determine how far it will travel in 5 hours.
     - Distance and time are directly proportional.
     - Solve for k: 60 = k * 2, so k = 30.
     - In 5 hours, y = 30 * 5 = 150 km.

#### Inverse Proportion

1. Determine if the relationship is inverse by checking if an increase in one quantity causes a decrease in the other.
2. Use the formula y = k/x and solve for k if necessary.
3. Substitute values to solve for unknowns.

   - **Example**: If 4 people can paint a house in 6 days, how long would it take for 8 people?
     - Time and number of workers are inversely proportional.
     - Calculate k: k = 4 * 6 = 24.
     - For 8 workers, y = 24/8 = 3 days.

## 1.9 Basics of Exponents

### Definition of Exponents

An **exponent** refers to the number of times a number (called the **base**) is multiplied by itself. It is written as a small number above and to the right of the base.

- **Notation**: a^n, where:
  - **a** is the **base**.
  - **n** is the **exponent** (or **power**), which tells us how many times the base is multiplied by itself.

- **Example**: 5^3 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.

### Key Terminology

- **Base**: The number being multiplied.
- **Exponent (or Power)**: The number indicating how many times the base is multiplied.
- **Expression**: The combination of a base and an exponent (e.g., 2^4).

### Rules of Exponents

1. **Product Rule**: When multiplying two powers with the same base, add their exponents.

   - Formula: a^m * a^n = a^(m+n)
   - **Example**: 3^2 * 3^4 = 3^(2+4) = 3^6 = 729

2. **Quotient Rule**: When dividing two powers with the same base, subtract their exponents.

   - Formula: a^m / a^n = a^(m-n)
   - **Example**: 5^5 / 5^2 = 5^(5-2) = 5^3 = 125

3. **Power of a Power Rule**: When raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents.

   - Formula: (a^m)^n = a^(m * n)
   - **Example**: (2^3)^4 = 2^(3 * 4) = 2^12 = 4096

4. **Power of a Product Rule**: When raising a product to a power, apply the exponent to each factor.

   - Formula: (a * b)^n = a^n * b^n
   - **Example**: (3 * 4)^2 = 3^2 * 4^2 = 9 * 16 = 144

5. **Power of a Quotient Rule**: When raising a quotient to a power, apply the exponent to both the numerator and the denominator.

   - Formula: (a / b)^n = a^n / b^n
   - **Example**: (6 / 3)^2 = 6^2 / 3^2 = 36 / 9 = 4

6. **Zero Exponent Rule**: Any base (except 0) raised to the power of zero is equal to 1.

   - Formula: a^0 = 1
   - **Example**: 7^0 = 1

7. **Negative Exponent Rule**: A negative exponent represents the reciprocal of the base raised to the opposite positive exponent.

   - Formula: a^(-n) = 1 / a^n
   - **Example**: 4^(-2) = 1 / 4^2 = 1 / 16

### Fractional Exponents

Fractional exponents indicate roots. The numerator represents the power, and the denominator represents the root.

- Formula: a^(m/n) = n-th root of (a^m)
- **Example**: 8^(2/3) = 3rd root of (8^2) = 3rd root of 64 = 4

### Scientific Notation

**Scientific notation** is a way of expressing very large or very small numbers using exponents. It is written in the form:
a * 10^n, where **a** is a number between 1 and 10, and **n** is an integer.

- **Example**: The speed of light is approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s.

### Real-Life Applications of Exponents

1. **Population Growth**: Population growth can be modeled exponentially. If a population doubles every year, it can be represented as P * 2^n, where **n** is the number of years.

2. **Compound Interest**: In finance, compound interest grows according to an exponential function. The formula for compound interest is:
   
   - Formula: A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
   - Where **A** is the accumulated amount, **P** is the principal, **r** is the interest rate, **n** is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and **t** is the number of years.

3. **Physics**: Exponential decay models in physics, such as radioactive decay, follow the formula A = A_0 * e^(-Œª * t), where Œª is the decay constant.

## 1.3 Solving Inequalities

### What is an Inequality?

An **inequality** is a mathematical statement indicating that one expression is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another expression. Inequalities are used to represent ranges of possible values rather than exact solutions.

### Types of Inequalities

1. **Less Than**: \( x < a \)
2. **Greater Than**: \( x > a \)
3. **Less Than or Equal To**: \( x \leq a \)
4. **Greater Than or Equal To**: \( x \geq a \)

### Graphical Representation of Inequalities

Inequalities can be represented on a **number line** or a **coordinate plane**:

- **Number Line**: For inequalities in one variable, plot on a number line.
  - Use an **open circle** for \( < \) or \( > \) (not including the endpoint).
  - Use a **closed circle** for \( \leq \) or \( \geq \) (including the endpoint).

### Basic Rules for Solving Inequalities

The process for solving inequalities is similar to solving equations, with an important exception for multiplication and division by negative numbers.

#### Steps for Solving Inequalities

1. **Isolate the Variable**: Get the variable on one side of the inequality.
2. **Perform Basic Operations**: Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to simplify.
3. **Special Rule for Negative Multiplication/Division**: 
   - When you **multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number**, **flip the inequality sign**.

#### Examples

1. **Simple Inequality**

   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x + 3 < 7
   \]

   - Step 1: Subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     x < 4
     \]
   - **Solution**: \( x < 4 \)
   - **Graphical Representation**: On a number line, place an open circle at 4 and shade to the left to show all values less than 4.

2. **Inequality with Multiplication**

   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x \geq 8
   \]

   - Step 1: Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x \geq 4
     \]
   - **Solution**: \( x \geq 4 \)
   - **Graphical Representation**: Place a closed circle at 4 and shade to the right.

3. **Inequality Requiring Sign Flip**

   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   -3x > 9
   \]

   - Step 1: Divide by \(-3\), and flip the inequality sign:
     \[
     x < -3
     \]
   - **Solution**: \( x < -3 \)
   - **Graphical Representation**: On a number line, place an open circle at \(-3\) and shade to the left.

### Compound Inequalities

A **compound inequality** includes two inequalities connected by ‚Äúand‚Äù or ‚Äúor‚Äù:
- **"And" Inequality**: Represents the intersection of solutions (e.g., \( a < x \leq b \)).
- **"Or" Inequality**: Represents the union of solutions (e.g., \( x < a \) or \( x > b \)).

#### Examples of Compound Inequalities

1. **And Inequality**

   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   1 < x + 3 \leq 5
   \]

   - Step 1: Break it into two parts:
     - \( 1 < x + 3 \)
     - \( x + 3 \leq 5 \)
   - Step 2: Solve each part:
     - For \( 1 < x + 3 \): Subtract 3 ‚Üí \( x > -2 \)
     - For \( x + 3 \leq 5 \): Subtract 3 ‚Üí \( x \leq 2 \)
   - **Solution**: \( -2 < x \leq 2 \)
   - **Graphical Representation**: On a number line, use an open circle at \(-2\) and a closed circle at 2, shading the area between.

2. **Or Inequality**

   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x > 3
   \]

   - **Solution**: \( x < -1 \) or \( x > 3 \)
   - **Graphical Representation**: Place open circles at \(-1\) and \(3\), shading to the left of \(-1\) and to the right of \(3\).

### Interval Notation

In interval notation, we represent solutions as intervals:
- **Parentheses** \(( )\) are used for values that are not included (e.g., \(x < 4\) is \((- \infty, 4)\)).
- **Brackets** \([ ]\) are used for values that are included (e.g., \(x \leq 4\) is \((- \infty, 4]\)).

#### Examples

- \(x > 3\) in interval notation: \((3, \infty)\)
- \(-2 \leq x < 5\) in interval notation: \([-2, 5)\)

### Real-Life Applications of Inequalities

1. **Budgeting**: You may want to ensure that your spending is within a limit. If your budget is $500, you can set up an inequality such as \( x \leq 500 \) to show that spending ( \( x \) ) should not exceed $500.

2. **Speed Limits**: Suppose a speed limit is 60 km/h. The inequality \( v \leq 60 \) describes the allowable speed \( v \), which must not exceed 60 km/h.

| Type                      | Symbol         | Example          | Solution Notation           |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Less Than**             | \( < \)       | \( x < 4 \)     | Interval: \((- \infty, 4)\) |

| **Less Than or Equal To** | \( \leq \)    | \( x \leq 5 \)  | Interval: \((- \infty, 5]\) |
| **Greater Than or Equal To** | \( \geq \) | \( x \geq -3 \) | Interval: \([-3, \infty)\)  |

## 1.4 Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities

### What is Absolute Value?

The **absolute value** of a number represents its distance from zero on a number line, regardless of direction. Absolute value is always non-negative.

- Notation: \( |x| \)
- For any number \( x \):
  \[
  |x| = 
  \begin{cases} 
      x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
      -x & \text{if } x < 0 
   \end{cases}
  \]

### Absolute Value Equations

An **absolute value equation** is an equation that contains an absolute value expression.

#### General Form

For an equation \( |x| = a \) where \( a \geq 0 \):
- **If \( a = 0 \)**: \( |x| = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0 \)
- **If \( a > 0 \)**: \( |x| = a \Rightarrow x = a \) or \( x = -a \)

#### Steps to Solve Absolute Value Equations

1. **Isolate the Absolute Value**:
   - Ensure that the absolute value expression is by itself on one side of the equation.
2. **Set Up Two Cases**:
   - One case where the expression inside the absolute value is equal to the positive value.
   - Another case where the expression inside the absolute value is equal to the negative value.
3. **Solve Each Case Separately**.
4. **Check Solutions** (especially for extraneous solutions).

#### Example Walkthroughs

1. **Basic Example**

   Solve \( |x| = 5 \).

   - Case 1: \( x = 5 \)
   - Case 2: \( x = -5 \)
   - **Solution**: \( x = 5 \) or \( x = -5 \)

2. **Equation with an Expression Inside Absolute Value**

   Solve \( |x + 3| = 7 \).

   - Case 1: \( x + 3 = 7 \) ‚Üí \( x = 4 \)
   - Case 2: \( x + 3 = -7 \) ‚Üí \( x = -10 \)
   - **Solution**: \( x = 4 \) or \( x = -10 \)

3. **Extraneous Solution Example**

   Solve \( |2x - 1| = -3 \).

   - Since absolute value is always non-negative, there is **no solution** for this equation.

### Absolute Value Inequalities

An **absolute value inequality** can have the form \( |x| < a \), \( |x| > a \), \( |x| \leq a \), or \( |x| \geq a \).

#### Types of Absolute Value Inequalities

1. **Less Than (\( |x| < a \))**:
   - When \( |x| < a \), it implies a range of values: \( -a < x < a \).
   - Example: Solve \( |x| < 3 \).
     - **Solution**: \( -3 < x < 3 \)

2. **Greater Than (\( |x| > a \))**:
   - When \( |x| > a \), it implies two separate ranges: \( x < -a \) or \( x > a \).
   - Example: Solve \( |x| > 4 \).
     - **Solution**: \( x < -4 \) or \( x > 4 \)

3. **Less Than or Equal To (\( |x| \leq a \))**:
   - When \( |x| \leq a \), it includes the boundary values \( -a \leq x \leq a \).
   - Example: Solve \( |x| \leq 2 \).
     - **Solution**: \( -2 \leq x \leq 2 \)

4. **Greater Than or Equal To (\( |x| \geq a \))**:
   - When \( |x| \geq a \), it includes two ranges with boundaries: \( x \leq -a \) or \( x \geq a \).
   - Example: Solve \( |x| \geq 5 \).
     - **Solution**: \( x \leq -5 \) or \( x \geq 5 \)

#### Steps to Solve Absolute Value Inequalities

1. **Isolate the Absolute Value** if necessary.
2. **Set Up the Appropriate Range** based on the inequality type:
   - For \( |x| < a \), set \( -a < x < a \).
   - For \( |x| > a \), set \( x < -a \) or \( x > a \).
3. **Solve Each Inequality** separately.
4. **Express the Solution in Interval Notation** if required.

#### Example Walkthroughs

1. **Less Than Inequality**

   Solve \( |x - 2| < 6 \).

   - Step 1: Set up the inequality: \( -6 < x - 2 < 6 \)
   - Step 2: Solve for \( x \) by adding 2 to all parts:
     \[
     -4 < x < 8
     \]
   - **Solution**: \( -4 < x < 8 \), or interval notation: \( (-4, 8) \)

2. **Greater Than Inequality**

   Solve \( |x + 1| > 3 \).

   - Step 1: Set up the inequality as two cases:
     - \( x + 1 > 3 \) or \( x + 1 < -3 \)
   - Step 2: Solve each case:
     - For \( x + 1 > 3 \): \( x > 2 \)
     - For \( x + 1 < -3 \): \( x < -4 \)
   - **Solution**: \( x > 2 \) or \( x < -4 \), or interval notation: \( (-\infty, -4) \cup (2, \infty) \)

### Graphing Absolute Value Inequalities

1. **Number Line**: 
   - Use open or closed circles depending on the inequality symbol.
   - Shade the regions based on the solution intervals.
   
2. **Coordinate Plane**:
   - Graphing absolute value inequalities in two variables (e.g., \( |x - y| \leq 3 \)) involves shading regions based on distance from points or lines.

### Real-Life Applications of Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities

1. **Quality Control**: Suppose a factory‚Äôs output should weigh 10 grams with a tolerance of ¬±0.5 grams. This can be expressed as \( |w - 10| \leq 0.5 \), where \( w \) is the weight.

2. **Distance Problems**: If you are at mile 20 on a road and can travel up to 5 miles in either direction, the range can be expressed as \( |x - 20| \leq 5 \), where \( x \) is your possible location.

---

## 1.5 Systems of Linear Equations and Inequalities

### What is a System of Linear Equations?

A **system of linear equations** is a collection of two or more linear equations with the same set of variables. The objective is to find values for the variables that satisfy all equations simultaneously.

#### General Form

For a system with two variables \( x \) and \( y \), a system of equations may look like:
\[
\begin{cases}
a_1x + b_1y = c_1 \\
a_2x + b_2y = c_2
\end{cases}
\]
where \( a_1 \), \( b_1 \), \( c_1 \), \( a_2 \), \( b_2 \), and \( c_2 \) are constants.

### Methods for Solving Systems of Linear Equations

1. **Graphical Method**
2. **Substitution Method**
3. **Elimination Method**

#### 1. Graphical Method

In the graphical method, each equation is plotted on the coordinate plane. The point(s) of intersection, if any, represent the solution(s) of the system.

- **One Solution**: Lines intersect at a single point.
- **No Solution**: Lines are parallel and never intersect.
- **Infinite Solutions**: Lines coincide (overlap completely).

##### Example

Solve the following system:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 5 \\
x - y = 1
\end{cases}
\]

1. Plot \( x + y = 5 \) and \( x - y = 1 \).
2. Identify the point of intersection (3, 2).
3. **Solution**: \( x = 3 \), \( y = 2 \).

#### 2. Substitution Method

The substitution method involves solving one equation for one variable and substituting this expression into the other equation.

##### Steps

1. Solve one equation for one variable in terms of the other.
2. Substitute this expression into the second equation.
3. Solve for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute back to find the first variable.

##### Example

Solve:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 5 \\
x - y = 1
\end{cases}
\]

1. Solve the first equation for \( x \): \( x = 5 - y \).
2. Substitute \( x = 5 - y \) into the second equation:
   \[
   5 - y - y = 1 \Rightarrow 5 - 2y = 1 \Rightarrow y = 2
   \]
3. Substitute \( y = 2 \) back into \( x = 5 - y \): \( x = 3 \).
4. **Solution**: \( x = 3 \), \( y = 2 \).

#### 3. Elimination Method

The elimination method involves adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one of the variables.

##### Steps

1. Multiply one or both equations by constants to align coefficients.
2. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate a variable.
3. Solve for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute back to find the other variable.

##### Example

Solve:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 5 \\
x - y = 1
\end{cases}
\]

1. Add the two equations:
   \[
   (x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 1 \Rightarrow 2x = 6 \Rightarrow x = 3
   \]
2. Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( x + y = 5 \): \( 3 + y = 5 \Rightarrow y = 2 \).
3. **Solution**: \( x = 3 \), \( y = 2 \).

### Systems of Linear Inequalities

A **system of linear inequalities** consists of two or more linear inequalities with the same variables. The solution set is the region of the coordinate plane that satisfies all inequalities in the system.

#### General Form

For a system with two variables, it may look like:
\[
\begin{cases}
a_1x + b_1y \leq c_1 \\
a_2x + b_2y > c_2
\end{cases}
\]

#### Steps to Solve Graphically

1. **Graph Each Inequality**:
   - Draw the boundary line for each inequality (dashed for \( < \) or \( > \), solid for \( \leq \) or \( \geq \)).
   - Shade the region representing the solution to each inequality.
2. **Identify the Intersection**:
   - The solution set is where all shaded regions overlap.

#### Example

Solve the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + y \leq 5 \\
x - y > 1
\end{cases}
\]

1. Graph \( x + y = 5 \) as a solid line and shade below it.
2. Graph \( x - y = 1 \) as a dashed line and shade above it.
3. The overlapping shaded region is the solution set.

### Real-Life Applications of Systems of Equations and Inequalities

1. **Business and Finance**: To maximize profits or minimize costs, companies use systems of equations and inequalities to model constraints and make optimal decisions.

2. **Supply and Demand**: Systems of equations can represent relationships between supply and demand, where equilibrium prices are solutions to the system.

3. **Budgeting**: If a budget has constraints (e.g., spending on different categories like rent and food), a system of inequalities can represent these constraints.

# Chapter 2: Proportional Relationships

## 2.1 Understanding Ratios and Proportions

### What is a Ratio?

A **ratio** is a comparison of two quantities. Ratios can represent relationships in various ways, such as part-to-part, part-to-whole, or even rates.

- Notation: Ratios are written as \( a : b \) or as a fraction \( \frac{a}{b} \).
- Example: If there are 3 apples and 5 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is \( 3:5 \) or \( \frac{3}{5} \).

### Types of Ratios

1. **Part-to-Part Ratios**: Compares two parts of a whole.
   - Example: In a group with 7 boys and 3 girls, the ratio of boys to girls is \( 7:3 \).

2. **Part-to-Whole Ratios**: Compares one part to the total.
   - Example: Using the previous group, the ratio of boys to the total group size is \( 7:10 \).

3. **Rates**: A ratio that compares quantities with different units.
   - Example: If a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, the rate (speed) is \( \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \).

### Proportion

A **proportion** is an equation that states two ratios are equal.

- General Form: \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \)
- If two ratios form a proportion, the cross-products are equal: \( a \cdot d = b \cdot c \).

#### Solving Proportions

To solve for an unknown in a proportion, use cross-multiplication.

- Example: Solve \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{x}{8} \).
  \[
  3 \cdot 8 = 4 \cdot x \Rightarrow 24 = 4x \Rightarrow x = 6
  \]

---

## 2.2 Properties of Proportional Relationships

### Constant of Proportionality

In a proportional relationship, the ratio between two quantities remains constant. This constant is called the **constant of proportionality**.

- If \( y \) is proportional to \( x \), we write \( y = kx \), where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.
- **Finding \( k \)**: \( k = \frac{y}{x} \)

#### Example

If a recipe requires 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar, the constant of proportionality between flour and sugar is:
\[
k = \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Identifying Proportional Relationships

To check if a relationship is proportional:
1. **Find Ratios**: Calculate the ratios of the corresponding quantities.
2. **Check Consistency**: If all ratios are equal, the relationship is proportional.

#### Example

Consider the following table:

| Quantity \( x \) | Quantity \( y \) |
|------------------|------------------|
| 1                | 3                |
| 2                | 6                |
| 3                | 9                |

Since \( \frac{y}{x} = 3 \) for each pair, \( y \) is proportional to \( x \) with \( k = 3 \).

---

## 2.3 Graphing Proportional Relationships

### Characteristics of Proportional Graphs

When graphed, proportional relationships are represented by a straight line that passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).

- **Equation**: \( y = kx \)
- **Slope**: The constant of proportionality \( k \) is the slope of the line.

#### Example

If \( y = 2x \), the graph is a line passing through the origin with a slope of 2. For every increase of 1 in \( x \), \( y \) increases by 2.

### Real-World Graphing Example

Consider a car traveling at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour. The relationship between time and distance is proportional, where:
\[
\text{Distance} = 50 \times \text{Time}
\]
The graph is a line with a slope of 50, passing through the origin, representing distance traveled over time.

---

## 2.4 Applications of Proportional Relationships

Proportional relationships are used extensively in real-life situations:

1. **Scaling in Recipes**: Doubling or halving ingredients based on serving sizes.
2. **Converting Units**: Using a constant ratio to convert, e.g., kilometers to miles.
3. **Distance-Time Relationships**: Speed calculations in physics (e.g., if speed is constant, distance and time are proportional).
4. **Financial Proportions**: Exchange rates, taxation, or simple interest calculations where one quantity is proportional to another.

---

## Real-Life Example Walkthrough

### Problem: Converting Currency

Suppose you‚Äôre traveling and need to exchange USD for EUR. The exchange rate is 1 USD = 0.85 EUR.

#### Setting Up the Proportion

1. Let \( x \) represent the amount in EUR for a given amount in USD.
2. For 1 USD, \( x = 0.85 \) EUR, which forms the proportional relationship:
   \[
   \frac{\text{EUR}}{\text{USD}} = 0.85
   \]
3. To find the EUR equivalent for 100 USD:
   \[
   \text{EUR} = 0.85 \times 100 = 85
   \]

So, 100 USD is equal to 85 EUR.
