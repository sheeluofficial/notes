## 1.1 Numbers and Basic Operations

### Types of Numbers

1. **Natural Numbers**:
   - **Definition**: The set of positive counting numbers starting from 1 and continuing indefinitely. They are represented by \( \mathbb{N} \).
   - **Example**: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
   - **Real-Life Application**: Counting objects, like books, people, or steps.

2. **Whole Numbers**:
   - **Definition**: Natural numbers including 0. This set is represented by \( \mathbb{W} \).
   - **Example**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
   - **Real-Life Application**: Representing quantities where zero might be included, such as a bank balance or inventory.

3. **Integers**:
   - **Definition**: All whole numbers, including their negative counterparts. They are represented by \( \mathbb{Z} \).
   - **Example**: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
   - **Real-Life Application**: Temperature readings that can fall below zero, or financial credits and debits.

4. **Rational Numbers**:
   - **Definition**: Numbers that can be written as a fraction \( \frac{a}{b} \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers and \( b \neq 0 \). Rational numbers either have a terminating decimal form (e.g., 0.5) or a repeating pattern (e.g., 0.333...).
   - **Example**: \( \frac{3}{4} \), -2, 0.75 (or \( \frac{3}{4} \))
   - **Real-Life Application**: Splitting bills or converting measurements, such as 1.5 cups of flour in a recipe.

5. **Irrational Numbers**:
   - **Definition**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Their decimal representation is non-repeating and non-terminating.
   - **Examples**: \( \pi \approx 3.14159... \), \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414... \)
   - **Real-Life Application**: Calculating circumference of a circle (involving \( \pi \)) or working with diagonal measurements (involving square roots).

6. **Real Numbers**:
   - **Definition**: The set of all rational and irrational numbers, essentially covering all possible numbers along the number line. Represented by \( \mathbb{R} \).
   - **Examples**: 2, -3.5, \( \pi \), \( \sqrt{2} \)

### Properties of Numbers

1. **Even and Odd Numbers**:
   - **Even Numbers**: Numbers divisible by 2 without a remainder (e.g., 2, 4, 6, …).
     - **Example**: \( 8 \div 2 = 4 \) (no remainder).
   - **Odd Numbers**: Numbers that are not divisible by 2, resulting in a remainder of 1 (e.g., 1, 3, 5, …).
     - **Example**: \( 7 \div 2 = 3 \) with remainder 1.
   - **Real-Life Application**: Even numbers often come up in pairing situations, like seating arrangements. Odd numbers appear in cases where symmetry or pairing is not possible, like an odd number of rows in seating.

2. **Prime and Composite Numbers**:
   - **Prime Numbers**: Numbers greater than 1 with only two divisors: 1 and the number itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7).
     - **Example**: 5 is prime because it has no divisors other than 1 and 5.
   - **Composite Numbers**: Numbers with more than two divisors (e.g., 4, 6, 8).
     - **Example**: 8 is composite because it has divisors 1, 2, 4, and 8.
   - **Real-Life Application**: Prime numbers are used in encryption algorithms for secure communications.

3. **Positive and Negative Numbers**:
   - **Positive Numbers**: Numbers greater than zero (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
   - **Negative Numbers**: Numbers less than zero (e.g., -1, -2, -3).
   - **Real-Life Application**: Negative numbers are used to represent debt, temperature below freezing, and positions below a reference point (like sea level).

   - **Definition**: Combining two or more numbers to get a sum.
   - **Example**: \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)
   - **Properties**: Commutative (\( a + b = b + a \)) and Associative (\( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \)).
   - **Real-Life Application**: Summing expenses to calculate the total cost of purchases.

2. **Subtraction**:
   - **Definition**: Finding the difference between two numbers.
   - **Example**: \( 10 - 4 = 6 \)
   - **Properties**: Not commutative (\( a - b \neq b - a \)) or associative.
   - **Real-Life Application**: Calculating change returned after a purchase, or deducting expenses from a budget.

3. **Multiplication**:
   - **Definition**: Repeated addition of a number by itself.
   - **Example**: \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) (which is \( 6 + 6 + 6 \))
   - **Properties**: Commutative (\( a \times b = b \times a \)), Associative (\( (a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c) \)), and Distributive over addition.
   - **Real-Life Application**: Calculating total cost when purchasing multiple quantities of an item.

4. **Division**:
   - **Definition**: Splitting a number into equal parts.
   - **Example**: \( 12 \div 4 = 3 \) (each part is 3)

## 1.2 Properties of Numbers

### 1. Commutative Property

The **commutative property** states that the order in which two numbers are added or multiplied does not affect the result.

- **Addition**: \( a + b = b + a \)
  - **Example**: \( 5 + 3 = 3 + 5 = 8 \)

- **Multiplication**: \( a \times b = b \times a \)
  - **Example**: \( 4 \times 6 = 6 \times 4 = 24 \)

**Real-Life Application**: 
- **Addition**: When calculating total distance covered, it doesn't matter if you add morning and evening travel distances in any order.
- **Multiplication**: If you need to find the area of a rectangle, you can multiply length by width or width by length; the order doesn’t matter.

### 2. Associative Property

The **associative property** states that the way numbers are grouped in addition or multiplication does not affect the result.

- **Addition**: \( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \)
  - **Example**: \( (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9 \)

- **Multiplication**: \( (a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c) \)
  - **Example**: \( (5 \times 2) \times 3 = 5 \times (2 \times 3) = 30 \)

**Real-Life Application**:
- **Addition**: Calculating total weight of packages by grouping them in different ways doesn’t change the total weight.
- **Multiplication**: Grouping ingredients in a recipe for a larger batch doesn’t affect the end product.

### 3. Distributive Property

The **distributive property** relates addition and multiplication and states that multiplying a sum by a number is the same as multiplying each addend individually by the number and then adding the results.

- **Formula**: \( a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c) \)
  - **Example**: \( 3 \times (4 + 5) = (3 \times 4) + (3 \times 5) = 12 + 15 = 27 \)

**Real-Life Application**: 
- **Budgeting**: If you buy multiple items with different prices, you can calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them up to get the total.

### 4. Identity Elements

An **identity element** in an operation is a number that, when combined with any number using that operation, leaves the original number unchanged.

- **Additive Identity**: The number 0. Adding 0 to any number does not change its value.
  - **Formula**: \( a + 0 = a \)
  - **Example**: \( 9 + 0 = 9 \)
  
- **Multiplicative Identity**: The number 1. Multiplying any number by 1 does not change its value.
  - **Formula**: \( a \times 1 = a \)
  - **Example**: \( 7 \times 1 = 7 \)

**Real-Life Application**: 
- **Additive Identity**: Zero is commonly used as a starting or reference point, such as in temperature (0°C as freezing).
- **Multiplicative Identity**: Any scaling factor of 1 keeps the original size, as in “1x” settings for volume or playback speed.

### 5. Inverse Elements

An **inverse element** in an operation is a number that, when combined with another number, produces the identity element.

- **Additive Inverse**: The additive inverse of \( a \) is \( -a \), because \( a + (-a) = 0 \).
  - **Example**: The additive inverse of 5 is -5 because \( 5 + (-5) = 0 \).

- **Multiplicative Inverse** (Reciprocal): The multiplicative inverse of \( a \) (where \( a \neq 0 \)) is \( \frac{1}{a} \), because \( a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1 \).
  - **Example**: The multiplicative inverse of 4 is \( \frac{1}{4} \) because \( 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \).

**Real-Life Application**:
- **Additive Inverse**: In finance, earning back an expense (like a refund) cancels the debt created by the initial expense.
- **Multiplicative Inverse**: Scaling down measurements by half in a recipe involves using the reciprocal of the scaling factor.

### 6. Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)

The **order of operations** determines the sequence in which different operations should be performed in a mathematical expression to get the correct result. The order is as follows:

- **PEMDAS/BODMAS**:
  - **P/B**: Parentheses/Brackets
  - **E/O**: Exponents/Orders (powers and roots)
  - **MD**: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
  - **AS**: Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

- **Example**: Solve \( 3 + 6 \times (5 + 4) \div 3^2 \):
  - Step 1: Solve inside the parentheses \( (5 + 4) = 9 \).
  - Step 2: Calculate the exponent \( 3^2 = 9 \).
  - Step 3: Multiply and divide from left to right: \( 6 \times 9 = 54 \) and then \( 54 \div 9 = 6 \).
  - Step 4: Add \( 3 + 6 = 9 \).
  - **Result**: 9

**Real-Life Application**: The order of operations is used in calculations involving multiple steps, like budgeting, where priority is given to multiplying costs by quantities before summing them.

## 1.3 Divisibility Rules

Divisibility rules help us quickly determine if one number can be evenly divided by another without performing actual division. Here are the rules for divisibility by common divisors:

### Divisibility by 2
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).
- **Example**: 128 is divisible by 2 because the last digit is 8.
- **Real-Life Application**: Checking divisibility by 2 can help when splitting items equally between two groups.

### Divisibility by 3
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
- **Example**: For 153, the sum of digits is \( 1 + 5 + 3 = 9 \), and 9 is divisible by 3, so 153 is divisible by 3.
- **Real-Life Application**: This rule is useful in financial contexts where a bill or an amount needs to be split among three people or categories.

### Divisibility by 4
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4.
- **Example**: For 312, the last two digits are 12, which is divisible by 4, so 312 is divisible by 4.
- **Real-Life Application**: Divisibility by 4 is helpful in situations where items need to be divided evenly into four groups, such as seating arrangements.

### Divisibility by 5
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
- **Example**: 245 is divisible by 5 because the last digit is 5.
- **Real-Life Application**: This rule is commonly used in accounting for cash handling, as bills and coins are often in multiples of 5.

### Divisibility by 6
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
- **Example**: 114 is divisible by 6 because it’s divisible by 2 (last digit is 4, an even number) and by 3 (sum of digits \( 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \), which is divisible by 3).
- **Real-Life Application**: Divisibility by 6 is useful in tasks involving splitting items into 6 groups, like evenly distributing materials.

### Divisibility by 8
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number divisible by 8.
- **Example**: For 4,096, the last three digits are 096, and 96 is divisible by 8, so 4,096 is divisible by 8.
- **Real-Life Application**: Dividing items like blocks or tiles for construction into groups of 8 uses this rule.

### Divisibility by 9
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
- **Example**: For 729, the sum of digits is \( 7 + 2 + 9 = 18 \), and 18 is divisible by 9, so 729 is divisible by 9.
- **Real-Life Application**: Useful in checking divisibility for quantities grouped in nines, like certain packaging setups or shipments.

### Divisibility by 10
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.
- **Example**: 540 is divisible by 10 because the last digit is 0.
- **Real-Life Application**: Used in metric conversions or rounding numbers to the nearest ten.

### Divisibility by 11
- **Rule**: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including 0).
- **Example**: For 1,210, the alternating sums are \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) (odd positions) and \( 2 + 0 = 2 \) (even positions). \( 2 - 2 = 0 \), which is divisible by 11, so 1,210 is divisible by 11.
- **Real-Life Application**: This rule can be helpful in certain coding or encryption contexts where alternating sums are analyzed.

### Summary Table of Divisibility Rules

| Divisor | Rule Example | Rule Description |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 2       | Last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) | For even numbers |
| 3       | Sum of digits is divisible by 3 | Used in splitting sums |
| 4       | Last two digits form a number divisible by 4 | Useful for groups of 4 |
| 5       | Last digit is 0 or 5 | Cash and currency handling |
| 6       | Divisible by both 2 and 3 | Common for 6-part groups |

### Testing Divisibility with Examples

1. **Is 376 divisible by 4?**
   - **Solution**: Check the last two digits (76). Since 76 is divisible by 4, 376 is divisible by 4.

2. **Is 245 divisible by 9?**
   - **Solution**: Sum of the digits is \( 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 \), which is not divisible by 9. So, 245 is not divisible by 9.

3. **Is 3,564 divisible by 11?**
   - **Solution**: Alternating sums: \( 3 + 6 = 9 \) (odd positions) and \( 5 + 4 = 9 \) (even positions). \( 9 - 9 = 0 \), which is divisible by 11, so 3,564 is divisible by 11.

# 1. Arithmetic Fundamentals

## 1.4 Prime Numbers and Factors

### Prime Numbers

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means it can only be divided evenly by 1 and the number itself.

- **Examples of Prime Numbers**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
- **Note**: The number 2 is the only even prime number because any other even number can be divided by 2.

### Properties of Prime Numbers

1. **Uniqueness**: Prime numbers have only two divisors.
2. **Infinite Set**: There is an infinite number of prime numbers.
3. **Building Blocks of Numbers**: Prime numbers are the "building blocks" of the natural numbers, as any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (called prime factorization).

**Real-Life Application**:
Prime numbers play a key role in cryptography and security. Many encryption systems, such as RSA, use large prime numbers to secure digital communication.

### Composite Numbers

A **composite number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. This means it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.

- **Examples of Composite Numbers**: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, etc.
- **Note**: Every composite number can be factored into a product of prime numbers.

### Methods to Identify Prime Numbers

1. **Trial Division**: To determine if a number \( n \) is prime, test if \( n \) is divisible by any prime number up to \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - **Example**: To check if 29 is prime, check divisibility by prime numbers up to \( \sqrt{29} \approx 5.4 \). Since 29 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, it is prime.

2. **Prime Factorization**: Breaking down a number into a product of prime factors can help determine if a number is prime.
   - **Example**: For 20, we get \( 20 = 2 \times 2 \times 5 \), which shows it’s a composite number.

3. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: An ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a certain limit. It systematically marks the multiples of each prime, starting with 2, then moving to the next unmarked number.

   **Steps for the Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - Write down numbers from 2 up to the desired limit.
   - Start with the first prime, 2, and mark all multiples of 2.
   - Move to the next unmarked number, 3, and mark all multiples of 3.
   - Repeat this process until all multiples of each prime are marked.
   - The unmarked numbers are primes.

### Prime Factorization

**Prime factorization** is the process of expressing a composite number as the product of its prime factors. It’s unique for each number, known as the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**.

- **Example**: The prime factorization of 60 is \( 60 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5 \) or \( 60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \).

**Real-Life Application**:
Prime factorization is useful in finding the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) of numbers, essential for tasks like scheduling and dividing assets.

### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) or Highest Common Factor (HCF)

The **GCD** (or HCF) of two or more numbers is the largest number that divides each of them without leaving a remainder.

#### 1. Prime Factorization Method

In this method, we factorize each number into its prime factors and find the common factors.

- **Steps**:
  1. Find the prime factors of each number.
  2. Identify all common prime factors.
  3. Multiply the lowest power of each common prime factor to get the HCF.

- **Example**: HCF of 36 and 48
  - Prime factors of 36: \(2^2 \times 3^2\)
  - Prime factors of 48: \(2^4 \times 3\)
  - Common prime factors: \(2^2\) and \(3\)
  - HCF: \(2^2 \times 3 = 4 \times 3 = 12\)

#### 2. Euclidean Algorithm (Efficient for Large Numbers)

The Euclidean Algorithm is a highly efficient way to find the HCF, especially for large numbers. It uses division to repeatedly reduce the size of the numbers.

- **Steps**:
  1. For two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(a > b\)), divide \(a\) by \(b\) and note the remainder \(r\).
  2. Replace \(a\) with \(b\) and \(b\) with \(r\).
  3. Repeat until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the HCF.

- **Example**: HCF of 56 and 98
  - \(98 \div 56 = 1\) remainder \(42\)
  - \(56 \div 42 = 1\) remainder \(14\)
  - \(42 \div 14 = 3\) remainder \(0\)
  - HCF is 14.

#### 3. Division Method (Long Division for Finding HCF)

The Division Method is a variation of the Euclidean algorithm, where we repeatedly divide until the remainder is zero, similar to how we perform long division.

- **Steps**:
  1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number.
  2. Use the remainder as the new divisor and the previous divisor as the new dividend.
  3. Repeat until the remainder is zero. The last divisor is the HCF.

- **Example**: HCF of 150 and 275
  - Divide 275 by 150 to get a remainder of 125.
  - Divide 150 by 125 to get a remainder of 25.
  - Divide 125 by 25 to get a remainder of 0.
  - HCF is 25.

#### 4. Consecutive Integer Checking Method (Useful for Small Numbers)

This method involves checking numbers starting from the smaller of the given numbers and working downwards until a common factor is found.

- **Steps**:
  1. List all factors of the smaller number.
  2. Check each factor in descending order to see if it divides the larger number.
  3. The first common factor found is the HCF.

- **Example**: HCF of 30 and 42
  - Factors of 30: 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1
  - Testing these against 42, we find that 6 is the highest factor of both.

#### 5. Binary GCD Algorithm (Optimized for Computers)

This algorithm, also called the Stein’s Algorithm, finds the HCF using bitwise operations. It is efficient for binary systems (used in computing).

- **Steps**:
  1. If both numbers are even, divide both by 2 and double the result at the end.
  2. If one number is even and the other is odd, divide the even number by 2.
  3. If both are odd, replace the larger number with the difference and repeat.
  4. Stop when the numbers become equal, which is the HCF.

- **Example**: Find the HCF of 48 and 18 using the Binary GCD Algorithm.
  - Step 1: Both numbers are even, so divide both by 2 → 24 and 9.
  - Step 2: 24 is even, 9 is odd, so divide 24 by 2 → 12 and 9.
  - Step 3: 12 is even, so divide by 2 → 6 and 9.
  - Step 4: Subtract the smaller from the larger → 3 and 6.
  - Repeat until both numbers equal 3.
  - HCF is 3.
**Real-Life Application**:
GCD is useful for simplifying fractions, arranging items into groups, and optimizing resource use.

# 1. Arithmetic Fundamentals

## 1.5 Least Common Multiple (LCM)

### Definition of LCM

The **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two or more numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of these numbers. In other words, it is the smallest multiple that the numbers share.

- **Example**: The LCM of 4 and 5 is 20 because 20 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 4 and 5.

### Relationship Between LCM and Prime Factors

The LCM of two numbers can be found by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in their factorizations.

- **Example**: LCM of 12 and 15
  - Prime factors of 12: \(2^2 \times 3\)
  - Prime factors of 15: \(3 \times 5\)
  - LCM: \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60\)

### Methods to Find LCM

There are several methods to calculate the LCM of two or more numbers. Here are three commonly used methods:

#### 1. Listing Multiples Method

This is a straightforward method, where we list the multiples of each number until we find the smallest common multiple.

- **Steps**:
  1. List the first few multiples of each number.
  2. Identify the smallest common multiple in these lists.

- **Example**: LCM of 6 and 8
  - Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...
  - Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, ...
  - The smallest common multiple is 24, so \( \text{LCM}(6, 8) = 24 \).

#### 2. Prime Factorization Method

This method involves breaking down each number into its prime factors, then taking the highest power of each prime factor present in any of the numbers.

- **Steps**:
  1. Find the prime factors of each number.
  2. Identify the highest power of each prime factor that appears.
  3. Multiply these highest powers to get the LCM.

- **Example**: LCM of 20 and 30
  - Prime factors of 20: \(2^2 \times 5\)
  - Prime factors of 30: \(2 \times 3 \times 5\)
  - LCM: \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60\)

#### 3. Using the Relationship Between LCM and GCD

The relationship between the LCM and GCD of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is given by:

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]

This method is especially useful when the GCD is known, as it simplifies the LCM calculation.

- **Steps**:
  1. Calculate the GCD of the two numbers (using any preferred method).
  2. Divide the product of the numbers by their GCD to get the LCM.

- **Example**: LCM of 18 and 24
  - \(18 \times 24 = 432\)
  - GCD of 18 and 24 is 6.
  - \( \text{LCM}(18, 24) = \frac{432}{6} = 72 \)

#### 4. Division Method for Multiple Numbers

This method is effective for finding the LCM of more than two numbers. The process involves dividing the numbers by their common prime factors step-by-step.

- **Steps**:
  1. Write down all the numbers in a row.
  2. Divide by the smallest prime number that can divide at least one of the numbers.
  3. For each division, write down the result below the original numbers.
  4. Continue dividing the results by the next smallest prime factor until all entries are reduced to 1.
  5. Multiply all the divisors to get the LCM.

- **Example**: LCM of 8, 12, and 15
  - **Step 1**: Write 8, 12, and 15.
  - **Step 2**: Divide by 2 (the smallest prime factor).
    - Results: \(8 \div 2 = 4\), \(12 \div 2 = 6\), \(15\) (unchanged as it's not divisible by 2).
  - **Step 3**: Divide by 2 again for numbers still divisible by 2.

  - **LCM(8, 12, 15) = 120**.

### Real-Life Applications of LCM

1. **Scheduling Events**: LCM helps in finding common cycles. For example, if two tasks repeat every 4 and 6 days, respectively, the LCM can be used to determine when they will occur on the same day (e.g., every 12 days).
  
2. **Solving Problems Involving Rotations**: LCM is used in problems where events or signals with different periods synchronize. For instance, if traffic lights at two intersections change every 30 and 45 seconds, respectively, they will align every 90 seconds (the LCM of 30 and 45).

3. **Packaging and Grouping**: LCM helps in situations where items need to be grouped or packed evenly across multiple groups without leftovers.

## 1.6 Fractions and Decimals

### Fractions

A **fraction** represents a part of a whole. It is written as two numbers separated by a line, where the top number (numerator) indicates the number of parts and the bottom number (denominator) indicates the total parts that make up a whole.

- **Example**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) means 3 out of 4 parts.

### Types of Fractions

1. **Proper Fractions**: The numerator is smaller than the denominator.
   - **Example**: \(\frac{3}{5}\)
2. **Improper Fractions**: The numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.
   - **Example**: \(\frac{7}{4}\)
3. **Mixed Fractions**: A combination of a whole number and a proper fraction.
   - **Example**: \(1 \frac{3}{4}\)

### Converting Between Improper and Mixed Fractions

- **Improper to Mixed**:
  1. Divide the numerator by the denominator.
  2. The quotient is the whole number, and the remainder over the denominator is the fraction part.

  - **Example**: \(\frac{11}{4} = 2 \frac{3}{4}\)

- **Mixed to Improper**:
  1. Multiply the whole number by the denominator.
  2. Add the result to the numerator, and place it over the original denominator.

  - **Example**: \(2 \frac{3}{4} = \frac{11}{4}\)

### Operations with Fractions

#### 1. Addition and Subtraction

To add or subtract fractions, the denominators must be the same. If they aren’t, find the **Least Common Denominator (LCD)** and adjust the fractions accordingly.

- **Addition**: \(\frac{a}{d} + \frac{b}{d} = \frac{a + b}{d}\)
- **Subtraction**: \(\frac{a}{d} - \frac{b}{d} = \frac{a - b}{d}\)

  - **Example**: \(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\)
    - LCD of 3 and 4 is 12.
    - \(\frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{12}\) and \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12}\)
    - \(\frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{7}{12}\)

#### 2. Multiplication

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

- **Formula**: \(\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d}\)

  - **Example**: \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}\)

#### 3. Division

To divide fractions, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

- **Formula**: \(\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{d}{c} = \frac{a \times d}{b \times c}\)

  - **Example**: \(\frac{3}{5} \div \frac{2}{7} = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{7}{2} = \frac{21}{10} = 2 \frac{1}{10}\)

#### Fraction Simplification

To simplify a fraction, divide the numerator and the denominator by their **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**.

- **Example**: Simplify \(\frac{12}{16}\)
  - GCD of 12 and 16 is 4.
  - \(\frac{12 \div 4}{16 \div 4} = \frac{3}{4}\)

### Decimals

A **decimal** is another way to represent fractions, especially those with denominators that are powers of 10. Decimals are written with a point separating the whole number from the fractional part.

- **Example**: 0.75 represents \(\frac{75}{100}\).

### Types of Decimals

1. **Terminating Decimals**: Decimals that end after a certain number of digits.
   - **Example**: 0.5, 0.125
2. **Recurring Decimals**: Decimals in which a digit or group of digits repeats infinitely.
   - **Example**: 0.333... (can be written as \(0.\overline{3}\)), equivalent to \(\frac{1}{3}\)

### Converting Between Fractions and Decimals

#### Fraction to Decimal

1. **Divide the numerator by the denominator** to get a decimal representation.

   - **Example**: \(\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\)

2. **Recognize patterns** if the division does not terminate (e.g., recurring decimals).

   - **Example**: \(\frac{1}{3} = 0.333...\)

#### Decimal to Fraction

1. **For Terminating Decimals**:
   - Count the decimal places.
   - Use this count to write the decimal as a fraction over a power of 10 and simplify.

   - **Example**: 0.25 → \(\frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4}\)

2. **For Recurring Decimals**:
   - Let \(x\) be the decimal.
   - Multiply \(x\) by a power of 10 that shifts the recurring part.
   - Set up an equation to solve for \(x\).

   - **Example**: 0.666... = \(0.\overline{6}\)
     - Let \(x = 0.666...\)
     - \(10x = 6.666...\)
     - \(10x - x = 6.666... - 0.666...\)
     - \(9x = 6\)
     - \(x = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}\)

### Rounding Decimals

1. Identify the rounding position (e.g., nearest tenth).
2. Look at the digit to the right of this position:
   - If it’s 5 or greater, round up.
   - If it’s less than 5, keep the rounding position unchanged.

   - **Example**: Round 3.456 to the nearest tenth.
     - The answer is 3.5.

### Real-Life Applications of Fractions and Decimals

1. **Financial Transactions**: Fractions and decimals are essential in currency calculations, tax, discounts, and interest rates.
2. **Cooking and Measurements**: Recipes often require fractional quantities (e.g., \( \frac{1}{4}\) cup) and measurements may use decimals for precision.
3. **Time and Distance Calculations**: Time often requires conversions between fractional hours and decimals (e.g., 1.5 hours as 1 hour and 30 minutes).
4. **Engineering and Construction**: Dimensions are often represented as decimals for precise measurements, and fractions are used for sizing materials (e.g., lumber size).

## 1.7 Percentages

### Definition of Percentage

A **percentage** is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The symbol "%" is used to denote a percentage. In mathematics, percentages are a way to express proportions, comparisons, and ratios.

- **Example**: 50% means 50 out of 100 or \( \frac{50}{100} = 0.5 \).

### Converting Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages

#### 1. Fraction to Percentage

To convert a fraction to a percentage:
1. Divide the numerator by the denominator to get a decimal.
2. Multiply by 100 and add the "%" symbol.

- **Example**: \(\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \times 100 = 75\%\)

#### 2. Decimal to Percentage

To convert a decimal to a percentage:
1. Multiply the decimal by 100 and add the "%" symbol.

- **Example**: \(0.35 \times 100 = 35\%\)

#### 3. Percentage to Fraction

To convert a percentage to a fraction:
1. Write the percentage as a fraction over 100.
2. Simplify the fraction if possible.

- **Example**: \(40\% = \frac{40}{100} = \frac{2}{5}\)

#### 4. Percentage to Decimal

To convert a percentage to a decimal:
1. Divide the percentage by 100.

- **Example**: \(25\% = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25\)

### Finding Percentages of Numbers

To find a percentage of a number:
1. Convert the percentage to a decimal.
2. Multiply the decimal by the number.

- **Example**: 30% of 200
  - \(30\% = 0.3\)
  - \(0.3 \times 200 = 60\)

### Percentage Increase and Decrease

**1. Percentage Increase**: The percentage by which an original amount is increased.

- **Formula**:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage Increase} = \frac{\text{New Value - Original Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100
  \]

- **Example**: Original price = $50, New price = $65
  - Increase = \(65 - 50 = 15\)
  - \(\text{Percentage Increase} = \frac{15}{50} \times 100 = 30\%\)

**2. Percentage Decrease**: The percentage by which an original amount is reduced.

- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Percentage Decrease} = \frac{\text{Original Value - New Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100
  \]

- **Example**: Original price = $80, New price = $60
  - Decrease = \(80 - 60 = 20\)
  - \(\text{Percentage Decrease} = \frac{20}{80} \times 100 = 25\%\)

### Real-Life Applications of Percentages

1. **Discounts in Shopping**: Retailers often offer percentage discounts on items. If an item is 20% off, the customer pays 80% of the original price.

   - **Example**: Original price = $100, Discount = 20%
     - Amount to pay = \(100 - (100 \times 0.2) = 80\)

2. **Interest Rates**: Banks calculate interest as a percentage of the principal amount. The interest rate indicates how much one earns or pays back over a given time period.

3. **Tax Calculations**: Taxes are often calculated as a percentage of income or sale prices. A sales tax of 8% on a $50 item adds $4, making the total $54.

4. **Population Growth**: Population changes are often measured in percentage terms, indicating growth or decrease over a period.

   - **Example**: If a town’s population of 10,000 increases by 5%, the new population = \(10,000 + (10,000 \times 0.05) = 10,500\).
