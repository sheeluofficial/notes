## Key Reasons Why Applications Are OS-Specific
1. System Calls are OS-Specific
  - What are system calls? System calls are a set of functions provided by the operating system that allow an application to request services from the kernel (the core of the OS). For example, an application may ask the OS to open a file, allocate memory, or communicate with a network device.

  - Why are system calls different? Each OS is built differently, meaning that the way it manages its hardware resources—memory, processors, and input/output devices—is unique. As a result, the system calls that an application uses to request services from the OS differ between Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, etc.

  - Example: If an application uses a system call to open a file on Linux, the function signature (the format and type of inputs/outputs) will be different than the one on Windows or macOS. As a result, the application will fail if it tries to run on an OS for which it wasn’t compiled.

2. Binary Formats are OS-Specific
  - What is a binary format? When a program is compiled (converted from source code into machine code that the CPU can understand), it’s packaged in a specific format, called a binary. This binary format is like a blueprint that tells the OS how to read, load, and execute the application.

  - Why do binary formats differ? Each OS has its own structure for binaries that dictate how instructions and data should be organized. For example, Linux uses the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), whereas Windows uses PE (Portable Executable) format. These formats are incompatible, so an application compiled into ELF format won’t be readable or executable by Windows, and vice versa.

  - Example: If you take a program compiled on Linux in ELF format and try to run it on Windows, the Windows OS won’t understand the binary format and will simply refuse to execute it.

3. CPU Instruction Sets are Different
  - What is a CPU instruction set? The CPU (Central Processing Unit) processes instructions in machine code, which is a low-level language specific to each type of CPU architecture. Popular architectures include Intel x86, AMD64, and ARM. Each CPU type has its own set of instructions that it can understand and execute.

  - Why does this matter? Applications are compiled into machine code that matches the specific instruction set of the CPU it is designed to run on. If you try to run an application on a different type of CPU, it may not understand the instructions.

  - Example: An application compiled for an Intel x86 CPU (used in many PCs) won't run on an ARM CPU (used in smartphones) unless it has been recompiled or emulated to work on that architecture.

4. System Libraries and APIs are Different
  - What are system libraries? Most operating systems provide a set of shared libraries, such as standard functions for graphics rendering, file I/O, or networking. Applications rely on these libraries to perform common tasks.

  - Why are system libraries different? The libraries provided by each OS are written specifically to interact with that OS’s internal structures and system calls. For example, macOS uses its own graphical libraries (like Cocoa), while Linux uses different libraries (like GTK or Qt). An application built with macOS libraries won’t work on Linux, as it won’t have access to the same functions or expect the same behavior from the OS.

  - What about APIs? APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a standard way for an application to interact with OS services. Just like system libraries, APIs differ between operating systems, which makes it difficult for a single application to run on multiple platforms unless it is adapted.

  - Example: A game that uses the DirectX API (for graphics) on Windows won’t work on Linux, which uses OpenGL or Vulkan for the same purpose.

5. Differences in System Calls and API Implementation
Even if two operating systems support similar functions (e.g., creating files, opening network connections), the way they implement and expose these functions to applications can be very different. This includes:

  - Different function names and parameters: For example, opening a file on Linux uses the open() system call, while Windows uses CreateFile().
Ordering of operands: How parameters are passed to system calls can differ.
  - Different error handling: The way errors are reported by system calls can vary between OSes, meaning applications need to handle these differences.
### Solutions for Cross-Platform Applications
While OS differences present challenges, there are a few approaches developers use to make applications that can work across multiple platforms.

1. Interpreted Languages (e.g., Python, Ruby):

  - These languages don’t compile into machine-specific binaries. Instead, they run via an interpreter, which translates each line of code into native machine code at runtime.
  - Advantage: These languages are platform-independent as long as the interpreter is available on the OS. For example, Python code can run on both Linux and Windows, provided the Python interpreter is installed.
  - Disadvantage: Interpreted languages tend to run slower because the code is translated in real-time.
2. Virtual Machines (e.g., Java):

  - Some languages (like Java) compile code into an intermediate form called bytecode, which is not specific to any CPU or OS. This bytecode runs inside a virtual machine (VM), like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which abstracts the underlying OS.
  - Advantage: Java applications can run on any OS that has a JVM, whether it’s Linux, macOS, or Windows.
  - Disadvantage: Applications running on VMs generally perform slower than native applications and may not fully take advantage of OS-specific features.
3. Cross-Platform Development Tools (e.g., POSIX, Electron):

  - POSIX is a standard that helps maintain compatibility across UNIX-like systems. Applications using POSIX APIs can be compiled to run on different variants of UNIX (Linux, macOS) without extensive changes.
  - Electron allows developers to write web applications that can be packaged as desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - Advantage: Reduces the amount of code developers need to write for each OS.
  - Disadvantage: May still require some OS-specific modifications, and performance might not be as optimized as native apps.
### Why Not a Universal Solution?
Despite these efforts, developing truly cross-platform applications remains challenging for several reasons:

- OSes continue to evolve, with new system calls, libraries, and APIs being introduced.
- Different hardware architectures (CPU, memory, etc.) require specific optimizations.
- Performance trade-offs: Cross-platform solutions, like interpreters and VMs, are often slower than applications compiled specifically for an OS and hardware.

## Dispatcher vs loader 

### Dispatcher

**Purpose**: The dispatcher is responsible for context switching between processes in a multitasking operating system. It schedules and assigns the CPU to processes based on a scheduling algorithm.

**Role**:
- Chooses which process to run next.
- Takes a process from the ready queue and allocates CPU time to it.
- Maintains context switching, moving a process between the ready, running, and waiting states.

**Example**: If there are multiple processes ready to run, the dispatcher switches the CPU between these processes to give each of them time to execute.

---

### Loader

**Purpose**: The loader is responsible for loading executable code into memory. It prepares the program for execution by placing it in the appropriate memory locations.

**Role**:
- Loads programs and data into memory.
- Allocates memory space for the program.
- Resolves addresses and performs relocations.

**Example**: When you open an application, the loader loads the required program code into memory and starts the execution by jumping to the program's entry point.
