# Attributes of a Process in an Operating System

In an operating system, each process is represented by a set of attributes that the OS uses to manage, schedule, and monitor it. Understanding these attributes provides insight into how the OS organizes processes, assigns resources, and ensures efficient multitasking.

---

## 1. **Process ID (PID)**
- **Definition**: A unique integer assigned to each process when it is created.
- **Purpose**: Used by the OS to track and manage individual processes.
- **Usage**: Enables inter-process communication (IPC) and allows utilities to manage processes.
- **Example**: Each application gets a unique PID, which helps identify and control specific applications in a system.

---

## 2. **Process State**
- **Definition**: Represents the current status of a process in its lifecycle.
- **Possible States**:
  - **New**: The process is being created.
  - **Ready**: The process is ready to run and waiting for CPU allocation.
  - **Running**: The process is actively executing on the CPU.
  - **Waiting (Blocked)**: The process is waiting for an external event (like I/O).
  - **Terminated**: The process has completed or been stopped by the OS.
- **Purpose**: Helps the OS decide which processes to schedule based on their state.

---

## 3. **Program Counter (PC)**
- **Definition**: A register that holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that processes can resume where they left off after interruptions.
- **Usage**: During a context switch, the OS saves the PC to allow process resumption.
- **Example**: In a multi-threaded application, each thread has its own PC, ensuring each thread’s execution continuity.

---

## 4. **Process Priority**
- **Definition**: A value assigned to determine a process’s importance or urgency.
- **Purpose**: Influences scheduling, allowing higher-priority tasks to access the CPU first.
- **Usage**: System-critical tasks are often assigned higher priorities to ensure responsive performance.
- **Example**: Antivirus scans may have higher priority, while background tasks are given lower priority.

---

## 5. **CPU Registers**
- **Definition**: Temporary storage locations within the CPU that hold data, addresses, and instructions.
- **Types of Registers**:
  - **General-Purpose Registers** (e.g., AX, BX, CX): Used for arithmetic and data storage.
  - **Special-Purpose Registers**:
    - **Accumulator (ACC)**: Used in arithmetic operations.
    - **Index Registers (SI, DI)**: Often used in array processing.
    - **Stack Pointer (SP)**: Points to the top of the stack.
    - **Base Pointer (BP)**: Reference point within the stack for accessing function data.
    - **Program Counter (PC)**: Holds the address of the next instruction.
    - **Flags Register**: Stores status flags for conditional operations.
- **Context Switching and Register Management**:
  - During a context switch, the OS saves all registers in the **Process Control Block (PCB)** of the current process.
  - The OS restores these registers from the PCB when the process resumes, allowing it to continue as if uninterrupted.

---

## 6. **Memory Limits**
- **Definition**: The memory range allocated to a process.
- **Purpose**: Prevents processes from accessing memory outside their allocation, ensuring process isolation and security.
- **Usage**: The OS manages each process’s memory boundaries to avoid conflicts.
- **Example**: A text editor’s allocated memory prevents it from interfering with other applications’ memory.

---

## 7. **Open Files List**
- **Definition**: A list that tracks all files currently open by a process.
- **Contents**:
  - **File Descriptor**: Unique identifier assigned by the OS for each open file.
  - **File Control Block (FCB)**: Metadata about the file, like file name, size, and access permissions.
  - **Access Mode**: Specifies if the file is open for reading, writing, or both.
  - **Lock Status**: Ensures exclusive access if the file is locked.
- **Management**:
  - When a process opens a file, the OS assigns a file descriptor, storing it in the Open Files List.
  - When a file is closed, its descriptor is removed, releasing resources.
  - **System-Wide File Table**: The OS also maintains a table tracking every open file across all processes.
- **Example**: A web browser’s open file list includes files for cached data, managed by the OS to prevent conflicts and ensure smooth access.

---

## 8. **Accounting Information**
- **Definition**: Tracks resources consumed by a process (CPU time, memory, I/O operations).
- **Purpose**: Useful for monitoring performance, resource allocation, and identifying resource-intensive processes.
- **Usage**: Administrators and the OS use this information for performance analysis and optimization.
- **Example**: System utilities display CPU and memory usage, helping users manage resource-heavy processes.

---

## 9. **I/O Status Information**
- **Definition**: Details about the I/O devices used by a process and the status of ongoing I/O operations.
- **Contents**:
  - **Device ID**: Identifies the specific I/O device (disk, printer).
  - **Buffer Information**: Location in memory for temporarily storing data during transfers.
  - **Transfer State**: Indicates if an I/O operation is in-progress, pending, or complete.
  - **Error Information**: Contains error codes or descriptions if an I/O failure occurs.
- **Management**:
  - When a process requests I/O, the OS allocates a buffer and assigns a request ID.
  - The OS schedules I/O operations based on priority and device availability.
  - **Interrupt Handling**: On I/O completion, the OS updates the I/O status and may notify the process.
- **Example**: A printing process’s I/O status information includes the printer’s device ID, transfer state, and any error codes if an issue arises.

# In-Depth Notes on Process Creation

Creating a process is a multi-step operation that involves the OS, CPU, memory, and other hardware and software resources. Below are the steps, including specific roles of components, exact scenarios for moving to the Ready state, and resource allocation.

---

## 1. **What is a Process?**
- A **process** is an instance of a program running on a computer, containing:
  - The executable code
  - Data (variables and resources)
  - Resources for managing and executing the program, like memory, CPU, and I/O.

---

## 2. **Process Creation Steps and Component Roles**

### Step 1: **Request for Process Creation**
- **How It's Initiated**: A process can be created by:
  - A user action (e.g., opening an application like a web browser).
  - Another process, using system calls like `fork()` (in UNIX) or `CreateProcess()` (in Windows).
  - System tasks like starting background services on boot-up.

- **Role of the OS**: When the OS receives a process creation request, it first checks system resources to ensure there's enough memory, CPU, and I/O capacity to create and run the new process.

---

### Step 2: **Allocate Process Control Block (PCB)**
- **Process Control Block (PCB)**: A data structure created by the OS to store essential information about the process. It includes:
  - **Process ID (PID)**: Unique identifier for the process.
  - **Program Counter (PC)**: Points to the next instruction.
  - **CPU registers**: Store temporary data during execution.
  - **Memory limits**: Defines memory space allocated to the process.
  - **I/O information**: Tracks files and I/O devices in use.

- **How the OS Uses the PCB**: The OS creates and maintains the PCB throughout the process's lifecycle. This PCB is stored in the OS kernel, ensuring it’s secure and accessible when the process changes states or requires resources.

### Step 3: **Loading Program Code and Data into Memory**
- **Memory Allocation**: The OS loads the program’s executable code, global/static variables, and initial data into **main memory (RAM)**. Memory is allocated in segments:
  - **Text Segment**: Stores the executable code.
  - **Data Segment**: Holds global and static variables.
  - **Stack Segment**: Manages function calls and local variables.
  - **Heap Segment**: Used for dynamically allocated memory during runtime.

- **How the OS Manages Memory**:
  - The OS sets memory boundaries to protect other processes from accessing the memory of this new process.
  - The OS may also reserve additional resources if the program is expected to dynamically allocate memory during execution.

### Step 4: **Setting Up CPU Registers and Program Counter (PC)**
- **Program Counter (PC)**: Initialized to point to the first instruction of the program in memory.
- **CPU Registers**: Set up with initial data and values needed for the first instructions.

- **How the CPU Prepares for Execution**:
  - The OS loads the program counter and registers with data needed to begin the execution.
  - This setup allows the process to start seamlessly when it’s moved to the Running state.

### Step 5: **Assigning File Descriptors and I/O Setup**
- **File Descriptors**: The OS assigns basic file descriptors like:
  - **Standard Input** (stdin)
  - **Standard Output** (stdout)
  - **Standard Error** (stderr)

- **I/O Information Setup**:
  - If the process needs additional files or I/O devices, the OS prepares this information in the PCB.
  - For complex programs (e.g., a browser), the OS might pre-load configuration files and reserve network resources, but this is only partially done in the New state.

### Step 6: **Moving to Ready State**

The process needs specific conditions met before it can move to the **Ready state**:

- **Resource Allocation**:
  - **In the New State**: The process does not yet have **CPU time** or access to all required I/O resources, as these will be allocated when it’s Ready or Running.
  - **Transition to Ready**: The OS finalizes basic memory allocation, confirms file descriptors, and checks if there are sufficient CPU resources.

- **Role of the OS Scheduler**:
  - Once the process is fully loaded into memory and its PCB is configured, the OS moves it from the **New** state to the **Ready** state.
  - The **scheduler** places it in the **Ready Queue**, waiting for CPU time.

- **Exact Scenario for Ready State Transition**:
  - When all basic setup steps (PCB, memory loading, initial resources) are complete, the OS changes the process state to **Ready**.
  - Example: A text editor application is loaded and ready for execution but is waiting for CPU allocation.

---

## 3. **Components and Their Roles in Process Creation**

### A. **Operating System (OS)**
- **Creates the PCB**: Tracks process information, resources, and state.
- **Allocates Memory and Resources**: Ensures each process has the memory and basic resources it needs.
- **Manages State Transitions**: Handles the lifecycle of the process, from New to Ready, Running, and beyond.

### B. **CPU**
- **Registers and Program Counter**: Used to execute instructions once the process is Running.
- **Execution Control**: The OS scheduler allocates CPU time, enabling the CPU to execute process instructions.

### C. **Main Memory (RAM)**
- **Stores Process Data**: Allocates memory segments (text, data, stack, heap) to hold the process’s code and data.
- **Isolation and Protection**: The OS ensures that each process has isolated memory space to prevent interference.

### D. **Scheduler**
- **Controls Process Access to CPU**: Decides the order in which processes in the Ready Queue are assigned CPU time.
- **Optimizes CPU Utilization**: Balances process execution time and transitions processes between Ready, Running, and other states.

### E. **I/O and File System**
- **File Descriptors and Device Access**: Manages access to files and I/O devices, as defined in the PCB.
- **Resource Management**: The OS ensures files and devices are accessible only when the process is in the correct state.

---

## 4. **Lifecycle Summary**

1. **Request for Creation**: A new process is requested by a parent process or system call.
2. **PCB Allocation**: OS creates a PCB with process information.
3. **Memory Loading**: OS loads code and data into RAM, setting memory boundaries.
4. **CPU Register and PC Setup**: CPU is initialized with starting data and instructions.
5. **File Descriptors Assigned**: OS sets up standard input/output and any needed files.
6. **Move to Ready**: OS completes setup and moves the process to Ready state, awaiting CPU time in the Ready Queue.

This process ensures that a newly created process has the necessary resources and is isolated, safe, and ready to execute when given CPU time.

# Process States in Operating Systems

In an operating system, a process goes through multiple states from creation to termination. Each state represents the status of the process in relation to its execution and resource allocation.

![os states](../assets/os-process-state-diagram.png)
---

## 1. **New State**
- **Description**: The process is being created.
- **Key Actions**:
  - The OS initializes the process control block (PCB) with basic information (e.g., Process ID, memory limits).
  - Basic resources, such as memory and file descriptors, are allocated.
- **Transition to Next State**:
  - Once the setup is complete, the process moves to the **Ready** state, waiting for CPU time.

---

## 2. **Ready State**
- **Description**: The process is prepared to execute but is waiting for CPU allocation.
- **Key Actions**:
  - The process sits in the **Ready Queue** along with other processes waiting for CPU time.
  - The **scheduler** decides the order in which processes receive CPU time based on scheduling algorithms (e.g., round-robin, priority).
- **Transition to Next State**:
  - When the CPU becomes available, the process is moved from **Ready** to **Running**.

---

## 3. **Running State**
- **Description**: The process is actively executing instructions on the CPU.
- **Key Actions**:
  - The CPU executes the process instructions, updating the program counter and registers with each instruction.
  - The process may request resources (e.g., I/O devices) as it runs.
- **Transition to Next State**:
  - **If the process completes** its execution, it moves to the **Terminated** state.
  - **If it requests I/O** or other resources, it moves to the **Waiting** state until the request is fulfilled.
  - **If preempted** (interrupted by the OS to allocate CPU time to another process), it returns to the **Ready** state.

---

## 4. **Waiting (Blocked) State**
- **Description**: The process is waiting for an event to complete, such as I/O operations.
- **Key Actions**:
  - The process pauses execution while waiting for external events (e.g., reading from disk, network response).
  - The process remains in memory, but the CPU is freed up to run other processes.
- **Transition to Next State**:
  - Once the required event (e.g., I/O completion) occurs, the process is moved back to the **Ready** state, waiting for CPU allocation to resume execution.

---

## 5. **Terminated (Exit) State**
- **Description**: The process has completed its execution or has been terminated by the OS.
- **Key Actions**:
  - The OS deallocates resources, including memory, file descriptors, and the PCB.
  - The process’s exit status is recorded, and any dependent processes may be notified.
- **End of Lifecycle**:
  - After resource deallocation, the process is fully removed from the system.

---

## Additional Process State: **Suspended**

Sometimes, an OS may suspend processes to manage resources better. There are two types of suspension:

### **Suspended Ready**
- **Description**: The process is ready but has been temporarily moved to disk (not in main memory) to free up RAM.
- **Key Actions**:
  - The OS swaps the process to disk storage to save memory.
  - The process remains inactive until it's brought back to the **Ready** state.
- **Transition**:
  - When memory is available, the OS can bring the process back to the **Ready** state in RAM.

### **Suspended Blocked**
- **Description**: The process is both waiting for an event and has been swapped out to disk.
- **Key Actions**:
  - The process is waiting for an event (e.g., I/O completion) but is also stored on disk temporarily.
- **Transition**:
  - Once the event occurs and memory is available, the OS moves the process to the **Ready** state.

---

## Summary of State Transitions

| **Current State** | **Event**                   | **Next State**     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| New               | Process initialization done | Ready              |
| Ready             | CPU allocated               | Running            |
| Running           | CPU preempted               | Ready              |
| Running           | I/O or event request        | Waiting (Blocked)  |
| Running           | Execution completed         | Terminated         |
| Waiting (Blocked) | Event completed             | Ready              |
| Suspended Ready   | Memory available            | Ready              |
| Suspended Blocked | Event & memory available    | Ready              |

# Queues and Schedulers in Process Lifecycle

In an operating system, **queues** and **schedulers** manage process transitions and control CPU time allocation. Queues categorize processes based on their state in the lifecycle, while schedulers determine which processes to admit, execute, or pause at each stage.

---

## Types of Queues in Process Lifecycle

1. **Job Queue**
   - **Purpose**: Holds all processes that have been created and are awaiting admission to the system.
   - **How it Works**:
     - When a process is first created, it enters the job queue.
     - This queue contains all new processes that are waiting to be loaded into main memory for execution.
     - The **long-term scheduler** (or job scheduler) decides when to admit processes from the job queue to the **ready queue**, based on system load and memory availability.
   - **Scenario**:
     - A batch processing system with a high number of processes may use the job queue to delay lower-priority jobs until the system has more resources available.

2. **Ready Queue**
   - **Purpose**: Holds processes that are ready for execution and waiting for CPU allocation.
   - **How it Works**:
     - Processes in the ready queue have all required resources except the CPU and are ready to run whenever the CPU becomes available.
     - The **short-term scheduler** (or CPU scheduler) selects a process from the ready queue and assigns it to the CPU.
   - **Management**:
     - Typically operates on a FIFO basis, though priority-based or time-sliced scheduling may apply.
     - Processes can be preempted and placed back in the ready queue if interrupted or if their time slice expires.
   - **Scenario**:
     - In a round-robin system, processes in the ready queue are given fixed time slices on the CPU, rotating through until completion or preemption.

3. **Waiting (Blocked) Queue**
   - **Purpose**: Holds processes waiting for an external event or I/O operation to complete.
   - **How it Works**:
     - When a process requires an I/O operation or waits for an event, it moves from the running state to the waiting queue, freeing the CPU for other processes.
     - Each resource or event may have a separate waiting queue to track processes specifically waiting for that item.
   - **Management**:
     - Managed by the OS, which reactivates processes in the waiting queue once their required I/O operation or event is completed.
     - An interrupt handler or device driver may signal the OS when to move processes back to the **ready queue**.
   - **Edge Case**:
     - If a process needs multiple resources, it may either be placed in multiple waiting queues or managed within a combined queue that tracks all dependencies before moving the process to the ready queue.

4. **Suspended Queue**
   - **Purpose**: Contains processes that are in a suspended state, meaning they are temporarily out of main memory.
   - **How it Works**:
     - The **medium-term scheduler** may decide to suspend processes to free up memory for other, higher-priority processes.
     - Suspended processes are moved to secondary storage and remain inactive until the OS can bring them back to main memory.
   - **Types**:
     - **Suspended-Ready**: These processes are ready to run but are currently swapped out.
     - **Suspended-Blocked**: These processes are waiting for an event or resource and are swapped out.
   - **Scenario**:
     - When the system experiences high memory demand, lower-priority processes may be swapped out to allow other processes to continue running.

---

## Types of Schedulers in Process Management

Schedulers are algorithms that decide which processes move through various states, from admission into the system to CPU allocation. Each scheduler has a distinct role in managing system performance and resource allocation.

1. **Long-Term Scheduler (Job Scheduler)**
   - **Purpose**: Controls process admission from the job queue to the ready queue.
   - **How it Works**:
     - The long-term scheduler runs less frequently than other schedulers and manages the degree of **multiprogramming** (i.e., the number of processes in main memory).
     - It selects processes from the job queue based on criteria like priority, resource requirements, or CPU vs. I/O needs.
   - **Impact**:
     - This scheduler ensures a balanced mix of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes, optimizing resource usage.
     - It aims to maintain an efficient number of active processes, preventing memory overload while maximizing CPU utilization.
   - **Scenario**:
     - A system with limited memory might use the long-term scheduler to admit processes one at a time to avoid memory overloading, especially if processes have high memory demands.

2. **Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)**
   - **Purpose**: Allocates CPU time to processes in the ready queue.
   - **How it Works**:
     - The short-term scheduler operates frequently, often in milliseconds, to select a ready process for CPU execution.
     - It uses scheduling algorithms such as **round-robin**, **priority scheduling**, or **shortest job first** to decide which process should be executed next.
     - When a process is interrupted or its time slice expires, the scheduler selects a new process from the ready queue to execute.
   - **Impact**:
     - This scheduler directly influences CPU utilization and response times, aiming for quick process turnover and efficient CPU usage.
   - **Scenario**:
     - In a time-sharing system, the short-term scheduler may use round-robin scheduling to give each process a fair time slice on the CPU, enhancing response time for all active processes.

3. **Medium-Term Scheduler**
   - **Purpose**: Manages process suspension and resumption to optimize memory usage.
   - **How it Works**:
     - The medium-term scheduler is responsible for swapping out processes to secondary storage (e.g., disk) when memory is limited.
     - Processes are swapped back into main memory when resources allow, resuming in their previous state.
     - This scheduler typically prioritizes swapping out low-priority or long-waiting processes, freeing memory for high-priority processes.
   - **Impact**:
     - Helps balance memory load, ensures higher-priority processes have access to main memory, and improves system responsiveness.
   - **Scenario**:
     - In a multitasking environment with high memory demand, the medium-term scheduler may suspend background processes (e.g., large data analysis jobs) to allow interactive user applications to run smoothly.

---

## Summary of Queue and Scheduler Interaction

| **Queue**           | **Managed By**       | **Scheduler Action**                                    |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Job Queue           | Long-Term Scheduler  | Moves processes to ready queue based on memory/load     |
| Ready Queue         | Short-Term Scheduler | Allocates CPU time to ready processes                   |
| Waiting Queue       | Short/Medium Schedulers | Resumes processes when I/O or event completes             |
| Suspended Queue     | Medium-Term Scheduler | Swaps processes in/out to balance memory and system load |

# Times Related to Process Lifecycle

In process management, various time metrics help the operating system and users understand a process's performance and responsiveness. Here are the main types:

---

## 1. **Arrival Time (AT)**
   - **Definition**: The time at which a process enters the system or is added to the **ready queue**.
   - **Importance**: Helps in calculating metrics like **waiting time** and **turnaround time** for scheduling.

---

## 2. **Burst Time (BT)**
   - **Definition**: The total time a process needs on the CPU to complete its execution (also called **execution time** or **CPU time**).
   - **Importance**: Used by schedulers to decide which process should get CPU time, especially in algorithms like **Shortest Job First (SJF)**.

---

## 3. **Completion Time (CT)**
   - **Definition**: The time at which a process finishes execution and exits the system.
   - **Importance**: Helps calculate **turnaround time** and analyze how quickly processes complete.

---

## 4. **Turnaround Time (TAT)**
   - **Definition**: The total time taken from when a process arrives until it completes.
   - **Formula**: `Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time`
   - **Importance**: Measures the overall time a process spends in the system, a key metric for evaluating performance.

---

## 5. **Waiting Time (WT)**
   - **Definition**: The total time a process spends in the **ready queue** waiting for CPU allocation.
   - **Formula**: `Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time`
   - **Importance**: Indicates the delay experienced by a process, useful for evaluating process scheduling efficiency.

---

## 6. **Response Time (RT)**
   - **Definition**: The time from when a process arrives in the ready queue to the first time it gets CPU access.
   - **Formula**: `Response Time = First CPU Time - Arrival Time`
   - **Importance**: Crucial in interactive systems, as it measures how quickly a system responds to new processes.

---

## Summary Table

| Time Metric        | Definition                                        | Formula                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Arrival Time**   | When a process enters the system                  | -                                   |
| **Burst Time**     | Total CPU time needed for process execution       | -                                   |
| **Completion Time**| When a process finishes execution                 | -                                   |
| **Turnaround Time**| Total time from arrival to completion             | `CT - AT`                           |
| **Waiting Time**   | Time spent waiting in the ready queue             | `TAT - BT`                          |
| **Response Time**  | Time from arrival to first CPU access             | `First CPU Time - AT`               |

These time metrics are essential for evaluating and improving process scheduling efficiency in operating systems.

# First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling

**Definition**: 
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) is a basic, non-preemptive scheduling algorithm where processes are scheduled in the order they arrive in the ready queue. The first process to enter the queue is the first to get executed.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Non-Preemptive**: Once a process starts execution, it cannot be interrupted until it finishes.
- **Order-Based**: Processes are scheduled strictly by their arrival time.
- **Simple Implementation**: It requires minimal overhead and is straightforward to implement.

---

## How FCFS Works
1. Processes are added to a **queue** in the order they arrive.
2. The CPU picks the first process in the queue and runs it until it completes.
3. After a process finishes, the next process in the queue is selected.

---

## Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Very easy to implement due to the straightforward, FIFO structure.
- **Predictable**: The process with the earliest arrival time is always processed first, making the order predictable.

---

## Disadvantages
- **Convoy Effect**: Longer processes can block shorter ones, increasing the average waiting time.
- **High Waiting Times**: If a long job arrives first, it increases the waiting time for all subsequent jobs.

---

## Example

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
|---------|--------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0            | 4          | 4               | 4               | 0            |
| P2      | 1            | 3          | 7               | 6               | 3            |
| P3      | 2            | 1          | 8               | 6               | 5            |

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

In this example:
- Average **Waiting Time** = (0 + 3 + 5) / 3 = 2.67
- Average **Turnaround Time** = (4 + 6 + 6) / 3 = 5.33

---

## When to Use FCFS
- **Batch Systems**: Works well for systems where turnaround time is less critical.
- **Simple Environments**: Suitable for environments where simplicity and ease of implementation are prioritized.

---

## Summary
FCFS scheduling is the simplest scheduling algorithm but may lead to long waiting times due to the convoy effect. It’s best suited for systems where process order and simplicity are more important than overall efficiency.

---

# Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling

**Definition**: 
Shortest Job First (SJF) is a scheduling algorithm where the process with the shortest CPU burst time is selected for execution next. It can be **non-preemptive** or **preemptive** (also known as Shortest Remaining Time First, or SRTF).

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Non-Preemptive** (standard SJF) or **Preemptive** (SRTF): The algorithm can either allow a running process to complete or, in SRTF, interrupt it if a shorter job arrives.
- **Optimal** for Average Waiting Time: Minimizes average waiting time if all processes are known at the start.

---

## How SJF Works
1. Processes are added to a queue based on their arrival time.
2. The CPU selects the process with the shortest burst time from the ready queue.
3. In **non-preemptive SJF**, the selected process runs to completion.
4. In **SRTF** (preemptive SJF), if a new process arrives with a shorter remaining burst time than the currently running process, the CPU switches to the new process.

---

## Advantages
- **Efficient Waiting Time**: SJF minimizes average waiting time, making it optimal when process lengths are known in advance.
- **Good for Short Jobs**: Works well when shorter jobs arrive frequently.

---

## Disadvantages
- **Starvation**: Longer processes may be delayed indefinitely if short jobs keep arriving.
- **Difficult to Predict**: Requires prior knowledge of burst times, which may not always be possible.
- **Not Fair**: Prioritizes short jobs, potentially delaying longer processes significantly.

---

## Example (Non-Preemptive SJF)

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
|---------|--------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0            | 6          | 6               | 6               | 0            |
| P2      | 1            | 8          | 16              | 15              | 7            |
| P3      | 2            | 7          | 23              | 21              | 14           |
| P4      | 3            | 3          | 9               | 6               | 3            |

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

In this example:
- Average **Waiting Time** = (0 + 7 + 14 + 3) / 4 = 6
- Average **Turnaround Time** = (6 + 15 + 21 + 6) / 4 = 12

---

## When to Use SJF
- **Non-Interactive Systems**: Ideal for batch processing or non-interactive environments.
- **Known Job Lengths**: Effective when job lengths are predictable or well-estimated.

---

## Summary
SJF scheduling is efficient in minimizing average waiting time but can lead to starvation of longer jobs. SRTF (preemptive SJF) can handle dynamic job arrivals but adds complexity in managing frequent context switches.

---

# Priority Scheduling

**Definition**: 
Priority Scheduling is a scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a priority, and the CPU selects the process with the highest priority for execution. It can be **preemptive** or **non-preemptive**.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Preemptive or Non-Preemptive**: In preemptive priority scheduling, the CPU can switch to a new process if it has a higher priority than the currently running one.
- **Priority-Based**: Each process has a priority value, and processes with higher priority values are scheduled first.
- **Dynamic Prioritization**: Some systems allow priorities to change over time, often to avoid starvation.

---

## How Priority Scheduling Works
1. Each process is assigned a priority, which could be a fixed value or dynamic based on process type, age, or importance.
2. The CPU selects the process with the highest priority from the ready queue.
3. In **preemptive priority scheduling**, if a new process arrives with a higher priority, it can interrupt the currently running process.
4. In **non-preemptive priority scheduling**, the running process continues until completion, regardless of incoming processes with higher priority.

---

## Advantages
- **Control over Process Execution**: Allows important or time-sensitive processes to execute sooner.
- **Flexibility**: Priority levels can be adjusted based on process needs, user inputs, or system conditions.

---

## Disadvantages
- **Starvation**: Low-priority processes may be delayed indefinitely if high-priority processes continuously arrive.
- **Requires Priority Assignment**: The system needs a way to assign and possibly adjust priorities, which adds overhead and complexity.

---

## Example (Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling)

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Priority | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
|---------|--------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0            | 10         | 3        | 10              | 10              | 0            |
| P2      | 1            | 1          | 1        | 11              | 10              | 9            |
| P3      | 2            | 2          | 4        | 13              | 11              | 9            |
| P4      | 3            | 1          | 5        | 14              | 11              | 10           |
| P5      | 4            | 5          | 2        | 19              | 15              | 10           |

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

In this example:
- Average **Waiting Time** = (0 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 10) / 5 = 7.6
- Average **Turnaround Time** = (10 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 15) / 5 = 11.4

---

## When to Use Priority Scheduling
- **Real-Time Systems**: Useful in real-time systems where certain processes must be prioritized.
- **Systems with Varying Importance**: Ideal when process importance varies, like in operating systems that handle both user and system tasks.

---

## Summary
Priority Scheduling is effective for managing processes of varying importance but can lead to starvation without proper handling. Preemptive priority scheduling enhances responsiveness but requires additional overhead for context switching and managing priorities.

---

# Round Robin (RR) Scheduling

**Definition**: 
Round Robin (RR) is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot (called a time quantum) for execution. After its time quantum expires, the process is moved to the back of the ready queue, allowing other processes to execute in a rotating, cyclical manner.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Preemptive**: Processes are interrupted once their time quantum expires and are placed back in the queue if not finished.
- **Fairness**: Each process gets an equal opportunity to execute, making it a fair scheduling method.
- **Time Quantum**: The length of the time quantum significantly impacts the algorithm’s performance; it must be chosen carefully.

---

## How Round Robin Works
1. The ready queue is treated as a **circular queue**.
2. Each process is assigned a time quantum (e.g., 4ms).
3. The CPU executes each process for a maximum of the time quantum.
4. If a process finishes within the time quantum, it exits the system; otherwise, it is moved to the back of the ready queue for the next cycle.

---

## Advantages
- **Fairness**: Every process receives equal CPU time in a cyclical order.
- **Low Waiting Time**: Short processes complete quickly, as they only wait for one cycle of all other processes.
- **Good for Time-Sharing Systems**: Works well in environments where response time is crucial.

---

## Disadvantages
- **High Context Switching Overhead**: Frequent switching between processes can lead to overhead, especially with a large number of processes.
- **Choice of Time Quantum**: If the time quantum is too short, overhead increases; if too long, response time suffers.

---

## Example

Let's assume a time quantum of 4ms.

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
|---------|--------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0            | 5          | 9               | 9               | 4            |
| P2      | 1            | 8          | 17              | 16              | 8            |
| P3      | 2            | 7          | 20              | 18              | 11           |
| P4      | 3            | 3          | 10              | 7               | 4            |

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

In this example:
- Average **Waiting Time** = (4 + 8 + 11 + 4) / 4 = 6.75
- Average **Turnaround Time** = (9 + 16 + 18 + 7) / 4 = 12.5

---

## When to Use Round Robin
- **Time-Sharing Systems**: Ideal for systems that require responsiveness, like operating systems for desktops and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Environments**: Suitable for environments where users expect a fair distribution of CPU time.

---

## Summary
Round Robin is a fair and efficient scheduling algorithm that balances time among all processes. However, it requires careful choice of the time quantum to minimize context-switching overhead and maintain responsiveness.

# Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) Scheduling

**Definition**: 
Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) scheduling is a scheduling algorithm where processes are categorized into different queues based on specific characteristics, like priority level or process type (e.g., system, interactive, batch). Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithm, and processes are permanently assigned to a queue.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Multiple Queues**: Processes are divided into separate queues, each typically managed by different scheduling policies.
- **Queue-Based Prioritization**: Higher-priority queues are given CPU time first, and lower-priority queues only execute when higher-priority queues are empty.
- **Fixed Queue Assignment**: Once assigned to a queue, a process does not move to another queue.

---

## How Multi-Level Queue Scheduling Works
1. Processes are categorized into queues based on predefined criteria (e.g., priority, user vs. system processes).
2. Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm. For instance:
   - **Foreground queue** (interactive processes) might use Round Robin.
   - **Background queue** (batch jobs) might use FCFS.
3. Queues are prioritized; the CPU checks higher-priority queues first. Lower-priority queues only receive CPU time if higher-priority queues are empty.
4. Within each queue, processes are managed by the queue’s specific scheduling policy.

---

## Advantages
- **Efficiency for Different Process Types**: Each queue can use a scheduling algorithm that best fits its process type.
- **Clear Separation**: Separates system-critical tasks from user tasks, enhancing responsiveness for higher-priority processes.

---

## Disadvantages
- **Rigidity**: Processes are assigned to a specific queue and do not move between queues, which can lead to inefficiency if priorities or requirements change.
- **Starvation**: Lower-priority queues may rarely get CPU time if higher-priority queues are frequently occupied.

---

## Example

Let's assume three queues with different scheduling algorithms and priorities:
- **Queue 1** (System processes): Priority 1, uses Round Robin with time quantum = 2ms.
- **Queue 2** (Interactive processes): Priority 2, uses Round Robin with time quantum = 4ms.
- **Queue 3** (Batch processes): Priority 3, uses FCFS.

| Process | Arrival Time | Queue     | Burst Time | Scheduling Policy | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
|---------|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0            | System    | 6          | Round Robin (2ms) | 8               | 8               | 2            |
| P2      | 1            | Interactive | 4        | Round Robin (4ms) | 10              | 9               | 5            |
| P3      | 2            | Batch     | 8          | FCFS              | 18              | 16              | 8            |

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

In this example:
- Average **Waiting Time** = (2 + 5 + 8) / 3 = 5
- Average **Turnaround Time** = (8 + 9 + 16) / 3 = 11

---

## When to Use Multi-Level Queue Scheduling
- **Complex Systems**: Useful for operating systems that handle a mix of process types, such as real-time, interactive, and batch jobs.
- **Prioritized Environments**: Suitable when processes with different priorities or requirements must be managed separately.

---

## Summary
Multi-Level Queue scheduling allows for efficient management of different types of processes by segregating them into specialized queues, each with its own scheduling algorithm. However, it can lead to starvation of lower-priority processes if not managed carefully.

---

# Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling

**Definition**: 
Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling is an advanced scheduling algorithm that allows processes to move between multiple queues based on their behavior and requirements. Unlike Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) scheduling, MLFQ dynamically adjusts the priority of processes, aiming to balance responsiveness and efficiency.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Dynamic Queue Assignment**: Processes can move between queues, typically based on factors like how much CPU time they have used.
- **Aging and Priority Adjustment**: MLFQ adjusts a process's priority based on how long it has waited, ensuring fairness and preventing starvation.
- **Multiple Queues with Different Priorities**: Each queue has its own priority level, and each level may use a different scheduling algorithm.

---

## How Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduling Works
1. **Multiple Queues with Different Time Quantums**: The system has several queues, each with a different time quantum and priority.
2. **Process Promotion and Demotion**:
   - New processes start in the highest-priority queue.
   - If a process doesn’t finish within its time quantum, it is moved to a lower-priority queue with a longer time quantum.
   - Processes can be promoted back to higher-priority queues based on waiting time or other criteria (this prevents starvation).
3. **CPU Allocation**: The CPU always selects the highest-priority queue with processes waiting. Within a queue, processes are scheduled according to that queue's specific algorithm (usually Round Robin or FCFS).

---

## Advantages
- **Prevents Starvation**: Lower-priority processes are periodically moved up to prevent them from being indefinitely delayed.
- **Balances Response Time and Efficiency**: Short processes are handled quickly in higher-priority queues, while longer processes gradually move to lower-priority queues.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: MLFQ adapts to the changing behavior of processes, providing more flexibility than static priority systems.

---

## Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Implementing MLFQ requires careful management of queue priorities, time quantums, and promotion/demotion policies.
- **Tuning Sensitivity**: The algorithm’s effectiveness heavily depends on the correct choice of time quantums and promotion/demotion policies.

---

## Example

Let's assume a system with three queues:
- **Queue 1**: Priority 1, uses Round Robin with a 4ms time quantum.
- **Queue 2**: Priority 2, uses Round Robin with an 8ms time quantum.
- **Queue 3**: Priority 3, uses FCFS (no time quantum).

| Process | Arrival Time | Initial Queue | Burst Time | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
|---------|--------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0            | Queue 1       | 5          | 9               | 9               | 4            |
| P2      | 1            | Queue 1       | 9          | 17              | 16              | 7            |
| P3      | 2            | Queue 1       | 3          | 7               | 5               | 2            |
| P4      | 3            | Queue 1       | 12         | 20              | 17              | 5            |

In this example:
- **Processes start in Queue 1** and may move to lower-priority queues if they exceed their initial time quantum.
- **Waiting and Turnaround Times** are calculated based on when each process finishes and its total burst time.

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

In this example:
- Average **Waiting Time** = (4 + 7 + 2 + 5) / 4 = 4.5
- Average **Turnaround Time** = (9 + 16 + 5 + 17) / 4 = 11.75

---

## When to Use Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduling
- **Interactive Systems**: MLFQ is suitable for environments requiring a quick response for short tasks but also handling longer jobs efficiently.
- **Complex Workloads**: Works well in systems with a diverse mix of processes, like modern operating systems, where both short and long processes need to be managed.

---

## Summary
Multi-Level Feedback Queue scheduling dynamically adjusts process priority, balancing short response times with fair allocation for longer processes. It is highly flexible but requires careful tuning of time quantums and policies to achieve optimal performance.

# Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling

**Definition**: 
Shortest Job Next (SJN), also known as Shortest Job First (SJF), is a scheduling algorithm where the process with the shortest estimated burst time is selected next for execution. SJN can be implemented as a **non-preemptive** or **preemptive** algorithm, where the preemptive version is often called **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Shortest Burst Time Priority**: Processes with shorter burst times are given preference, which helps minimize overall waiting time.
- **Non-Preemptive and Preemptive Options**:
  - *Non-Preemptive SJN*: Once a process starts, it cannot be interrupted until it completes.
  - *Preemptive SRTF*: If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the currently running process, it preempts the running process.
- **Optimal for Average Waiting Time**: SJN provides the optimal average waiting time for a given set of processes, as shorter tasks are completed faster.

---

## How Shortest Job Next Works
1. **Burst Time Assessment**: Processes are sorted based on their burst time, with the shortest burst time chosen first.
2. **Non-Preemptive Execution (SJN)**:
   - The process with the shortest burst time is selected and runs to completion.
3. **Preemptive Execution (SRTF)**:
   - The CPU can be preempted if a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the currently running process.

---

## Advantages
- **Minimizes Waiting Time**: SJN is optimal in terms of minimizing average waiting time, making it highly efficient for jobs with known burst times.
- **Efficient for Batch Systems**: Works well in environments where task durations are predictable and response time is less critical.

---

## Disadvantages
- **Requires Knowledge of Burst Times**: In practice, knowing the exact burst time in advance is challenging, limiting SJN’s applicability.
- **Starvation**: Longer processes may experience starvation if there’s a continuous flow of shorter processes arriving in the queue.

---

## Example

Consider a non-preemptive SJN example with the following processes:

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
|---------|--------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0            | 7          | 7               | 7               | 0            |
| P2      | 2            | 4          | 11              | 9               | 5            |
| P3      | 4            | 1          | 12              | 8               | 7            |
| P4      | 5            | 4          | 16              | 11              | 7            |

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time** = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time** = Turnaround Time - Burst Time

In this example:
- Average **Waiting Time** = (0 + 5 + 7 + 7) / 4 = 4.75
- Average **Turnaround Time** = (7 + 9 + 8 + 11) / 4 = 8.75

---

## When to Use Shortest Job Next
- **Batch Processing**: Useful in batch processing systems where job durations are predictable and can be ordered by burst time.
- **Low-Variance Systems**: SJN is effective in systems with low variability in process duration, as it minimizes waiting time without high risks of starvation.

---

## Summary
Shortest Job Next is an efficient scheduling algorithm for minimizing average waiting time. However, it has limitations due to the need for burst time knowledge and the risk of starvation for longer processes.
